Dear Diary,

I (either: &quot;had trouble sleeping last night. I kept thinking about the journey ahead&quot;,&quot;slept like a rock last night. I am looking forward to getting started today&quot;,&quot;tossed and turned all night. I think I&#39;m nervous about getting started today&quot;,&quot;was up all night. I kept wondering about all the unknowns ahead of me on this journey&quot;).

We have to make a big decision today. We have to pick which wagon company I want to join. I know that a wagon company is a group of people who work together to safely make it across the Great Plains. So, it is really important I make the right choice.

We can choose from three wagon companies. They all have slightly different traits.

The first is captained by &lt;b&gt;Mr. Henry Taylor&lt;/b&gt;. He is a loud, outspoken man. (either: &quot;His gray whiskers are always in motion, as he seems to always be talking.&quot;,&quot;&quot;) He is direct and seems to get his way. His wagon company is around (random: 110,130) wagons strong. (either: &quot;I’ve heard big wagon companies like this mean that it is less likely that you will have to deal with bandits.&quot;,&quot;I’ve heard big wagon trains like that kick up a lot of dust.&quot;,&quot;&quot;)

The second is captained by &lt;b&gt;Mr. William Hutchins&lt;/b&gt;. He seems to watch and listen a lot before he speaks. (either: &quot;He sometimes spends quite a lot of time in discussion.&quot;,&quot;&quot;) He wears a wide-brimmed hat that shades the developing creases next to his eyes. His wagon company is around (random: 60,80)  wagons strong.

The third is captained by &lt;b&gt;Mr. George Powell&lt;/b&gt;. He is a very quiet man. He has dark eyes and seems to watch everything with a careful vigilance. (either: &quot;A few in camp say he’s too young to handle the burden of leadership of running his own wagon company.&quot;,&quot;&quot;) {(either: &quot;I’ve also heard that he’s made this trip a couple of times before.&quot;,&quot;&quot;)} His wagon company is made up of around (random: 23,36) wagons.

I also wanted to record that {(if: (($spouse is 1) and ($gender is 1)))[(print: $wifesname1) made me extra pancakes this morning. She&#39;s amazing!](if: (($spouse is 1) and ($gender is 2)))[(print: $husbandsname1) helped clean up after breakfast. He usually does, but today, he told me to just relax and put my feet up (so, of course, I did!).](if: $spouse is 0)[(print: $travelpartnername1) got up early today to make me some biscuit and gravy. It is one of my favorite meals and I am grateful.]} 

[[I think I&#39;ll talk with the others for a while to see if they have any recommendations.-&gt;camptalk2]]

[[I’m nearly ready to choose, but I need a bit more advise from the person most important to me.-&gt;familyatcamp1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="camptalk1a" tags="nofooterhere1" position="1800,1850" size="200,100">&lt;div id= &quot;arialfont1&quot;&gt;The campfires were burning as I sat down with a number of people also getting ready to start out on the trail.

An old scout and army man was talking the most. I think he said his name is Captain Marcy. &quot;Now, remember,&quot; he said, &quot;(either: &quot;wagons ought to be of the simplest construction. Wagons should be strong, light, and made of well-seasoned timber.&quot;,&quot;The wheels in particular need to be made of seasoned timber as the air on the prairie in the summer is very dry. If the wheels are made of green timber, they will split and crack.&quot;,&quot;your best wagons are made up in New Hampshire. They have the best close-grained oak and, as a result, are less prone to breaking on the trail.&quot;,&quot;the pole of the wagon should have a strong joint where it enters the hounds, to prevent the weight from coming upon it and breaking the hounds in passing short and abrupt holes in the road.&quot;,&quot;the perch or coupling-pole should be shifting or movable. This way if the wheel or axle breaks or some other accident happens where you have to abandon the wagon, a temporary cart may be constructed from the remaining portion.&quot;)&quot;

(either: &quot;I listened carefully as the sun slowly made its way down over the western horizon.&quot;,&quot; Some of the other people nodded in agreement.&quot;,&quot;The campfires crackled softly and the night grew darker.&quot;)

Captain Marcy (either: &quot;drank from a flask&quot;,&quot;drank some coffee from a tin cup&quot;,&quot;took a few bites of beans&quot;) before continuing. &quot;So, (either: &quot;you’ve got to make sure you examine your tires carefully. If the wheels don’t fit perfectly snug, you’ve got to reset them so they don&#39;t cause problems on the trail.&quot;,&quot;one of the main causes of accidents on the prairie arises from nuts coming off the numerous bolts that secure the running gearing. To prevent this, you need to rivet all the bolts. If you need to take off a wheel while on the trail, you can just file the ends of the bolts, and that is easy to do.&quot;,&quot;you should never overload your wagon. A six-mule wagon should never have over 2,000 pounds unless you have another wagon where you will carry grain for the mules. The grasses on the prairie are good enough for food if your wagon is only hauling a ton. More than that and the animals will not have enough energy and may not make it&quot;)&quot;.

&quot;One important thing to remember,&quot; he said, &quot;is that you&#39;re going to probably eat more than you would back home. Moving across the prairie is a lot of work and requires a lot of energy. You&#39;ll probably end up eating four or five pounds of food each and every day. Make sure you have enough for at least two weeks at any given point just in case you can&#39;t make it to a trading post to buy more.

Sure, you&#39;ll be able to find game on the trail, but you can&#39;t rely on that. So, pack plenty of food.&quot;

[[I appreciate his advice, so I&#39;ll stay up a bit longer and continue listening to Captain Marcy.-&gt;camptalk1b]]

Captain Marcy (either: &quot;tossed another log onto the fire&quot;,&quot;brushed some dust from his pants&quot;,&quot;took of his hat and examined it&quot;) before continuing. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;(either: &quot;there&#39;s been a lot of talk about that over the years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, you&#39;ve got three main choices. You can go with mules, horses, or oxen. If you&#39;re hauling on good roads, then mules are your best bet. They go faster, can tolerate heat better, and don&#39;t mind eating grass. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horses are also good as they&#39;re fast, but they tend to wear our over long distances. They also won&#39;t tolerate just grass for long. They prefer grain and will get ornery if they don&#39;t get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oxen, now, they are the slowest, but they will go day after day without complaining.&quot;,&quot;we&#39;ve been arguing about that for longer than I care to recall. Oxen are generally the best on a long trail. They are slow, but they will pull a load all day without complaining. They are also the cheapest choice, so this is why so many families will use them. Mules are better if you&#39;re traveling over roads. They can tolerate the heat better than oxen as well. I personally prefer horses as they can be used not only haul but can be used to scout or hunt when the need arises.&quot;)&quot;

His wife says, &quot;I like a captain who is (either: &quot;reliable&quot;,&quot;trustworthy&quot;,&quot;experienced&quot;). He should also be (either: &quot;straightforward&quot;,&quot;knowledgable&quot;,&quot;practical&quot;).&quot;

The man nods at his wife&#39;s comments. &quot;To be honest,&quot; he adds, &quot;I’d recommend (either: &quot;Mr. Porter&quot;,&quot;Mr. Hutchins&quot;,&quot;Mr. Powell&quot;,&quot;Mr. Porter&quot;,&quot;Mr. Hutchins&quot;,&quot;Mr. Powell&quot;,&quot;Mr. Hutchins&quot;).

&quot;Excuse me. Do you mind if I ask you a quick question?&quot;

The family stopped for a moment, looking at me.

&quot;Do you know how many people there should be in a wagon company? Is there an ideal number to have?&quot;

A (display: &quot;chardesr1&quot;) woman (display: &quot;camptasks1&quot;) (display: &quot;campactions1&quot;) and says, &quot;(either: &quot;I’ve always heard that somewhere in the range of 40 to 60.&quot;,&quot;I heard that somewhere near 50 wagons made for a good company.&quot;,&quot;I don&#39;t really know, but I&#39;ve heard somewhere near 50 or so wagons was a good number. I don&#39;t know how many people that would be. Sorry.&quot;)&quot; She returned to her work.

Another female in the camp, a (display: &quot;chardesr1&quot;), (display: &quot;chardesr1&quot;) woman says, &quot;About 50 or so (either: &quot;well-trained&quot;,&quot;experienced&quot;,&quot;courageous&quot;,&quot;strong&quot;) men is just about ideal. (either:&quot;Any less than that and you&#39;ll find yourself short of people to do the watch, go hunting, and things like that. So, yeah about four or five dozen seems about right to me. More than that and you’ll have too many people and wagons. It’d take forever to get started in the morning.&quot;,&quot;Too many more and it takes too long to get everyone started in the morning. Too few and you won&#39;t have enough men to do all the things you need while on the trail, like hunting, scouting, and standing watch at night.&quot;,&quot;You&#39;ll want enough men to take care of the wagon train. Too few and you can&#39;t do all you need. Too many and they just end up arguing with each other.&quot;)&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; the first woman said, looking up at me, &quot;when you&#39;re getting your wagon, don&#39;t get tricked into buying wheels made with green wood. They&#39;ll dry out on the prairie and fall apart.&quot; She returned to her work.

I thank them for taking the time to talk with me. 

{(either: &quot;As I was walking from their camp, one of their young children ran out in front of a horse and rider. I instinctively grabbed the child out of the way. The family was so thankful, they gave me ten dollars! Can you imagine that!(set: $money to $money +10)&quot;,&quot;Just as I was getting ready to leave, one of their children dashed out in front a horse and rider. The rider immediately pulled up, but it was too late. The small child was trampled. I can’t believe I was standing right there and couldn’t do anything to help. I feel so bad for that family.(set: $morale to $morale - 10)&quot;,&quot;&quot;)}

{(if: $farmer is 1)[I bought four good oxen and the gear to attach them to a wagon. I wanted to buy more, but I am afraid of running out of money. I was able to talk the prices down a little because I know a good animal when I see it.

I bought four oxen and the gear to attach them to a wagon. I don&#39;t know if they are any good or not, I&#39;m not a farmer. They all looked the same to me.

{(if: $teamster is 1)[I smiled. &quot;I sure do.&quot; I immediately began getting the team ready.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mr. Lang watched for a minute or so, then tipped his hat. &quot;Well, I guess our business is just about wrapped up here, (if: $gender is 1)[sir](if: $gender is 2)[ma&#39;am].&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I thanked him for his help. He wished me a safe journey, and we parted ways.

]}

&quot;First thing you&#39;ll want to do is to get your wagon on a piece of flat ground where it won&#39;t go rolling away.

&quot;If you can manage it, it is always best to have your wagon facing something that your oxen can&#39;t walk over. What I mean is if you can have them facing a building or a wall of trees, while you&#39;re hitching them up, they&#39;re less likely to take off on you.

&quot;Next, you&#39;ll want to make sure your wagon brake is on or there&#39;s something under a wheel to keep it from rolling either forwards or backwards. Check that the neck yoke is tied or chained on and the pin is secure.&quot;

&quot;Keep them ox secured so they don&#39;t start wandering away! Get the yoke on the least experienced ox first. Just by guessing that&#39;s probably going to be that one.&quot; He pointed at (print:$ox3). &quot;Hard to tell just by looking, but I bet I&#39;m right. Anyway, you&#39;ll want to keep your fingers clear of those rings. I&#39;ve known many people to get broken fingers &#39;cause they ain&#39;t careful.&quot;

I could feel my eyes starting to glaze over.

&quot;Next, check the neck yoke center ring position. Make sure it ain&#39;t stuck on something but is snug against the tongue. If you don&#39;t, and I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t at some point, everything will be hooked too loose. You won&#39;t be able to steer the team which is the whole point in doing all this.&quot; 

As he was talking, he was guiding me through the process. It made me feel a bit like a (if: $gender is 1)[schoolboy](if: $gender is 2)[schoolgirl], but I needed to learn. 

Mr. Lang spent the next half-hour finishing how to hitch up the team. &quot;Hook the inside trace and then the outside. Check to make sure everything is all lined up. Double and triple check everything. Then,&quot; he said most seriously, &quot;before you start driving, I&#39;d recommend you just sit a while in the wagon. Go over everything in your mind again. The quickest way to an accident is by not taking the time to think things over.&quot;

With that, he handed me the reins, wished me luck, and started to walk away.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Mr. Lang said, turning to me, &quot;there&#39;s one more thing.&quot;

I paused and looked at him.

&quot;Did you hear the story about the farmer who was on his way to town to sell his produce and to see the circus elephant?&quot;

I shook my head.

&quot;On the way to town, the farmer came across the traveling circus. He saw the clowns, the jugglers, and, most importantly, the elephant. Just as a smile was forming on his face, his horse became spooked by the sheer size of the elephant. It turned and ran away in fright. As it did so, it dumped all the vegetables on the ground, spoiling them, but the farmer said, &quot;I don&#39;t give a hang, for I have seen the elephant.&quot;

I looked at him.

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t see the elephant out there.&quot;

I thanked him, not really understanding what he was trying to tell me.

[[I&#39;m got my wagon. I&#39;ve got my team. All that&#39;s left is to get supplies.-&gt;continuebuying1]](set:$morale to $morale + 5)</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="discussthewheels1" tags="nofooterhere1" position="2100,3050" size="200,100">&quot;Now, before we get much further, I want to talk with you about your wheels. Wheels on the wagon go round and round. Simple but true. Now the thing with wheels is they will either make or break your trip. Literally. 

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard that driving a wagon over the prairie is so bumpy that all that jolting and banging is actually enough to churn butter. It&#39;s true,&quot; he said, with a look of astonishment, &quot;so, I&#39;ll let you in on a little trade secret.&quot; He leaned in closer. I could smell his breath. &quot;See those wheels stacked up against that wall?&quot; He nodded at them. &quot;See how they&#39;re all old, dull, and worn out? That&#39;s what makes it so bumpy on the trail. Those wheels ain&#39;t got no give to &#39;em.&quot; He was almost whispering now. &quot;See, what you want are some nice &lt;i&gt;green wheels&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; He nodded several times and stepped back.

&quot;Think of it like a stick or a branch. If you find an old branch and bend it, what happens? That&#39;s right, it snaps. But a young branch freshly cut from a tree, now it won&#39;t do that, will it? No, it sure won&#39;t. It&#39;ll flex and bend. 

So, you can imagine being out on the trail, riding along,&quot; he mimed bouncing up and down. &quot;Now if you had these green wheels over here,&quot; he motioned to another area, &quot;you&#39;re ride would be as smooth as you can imagine.&quot; He stopped bouncing and smiled. &quot;Now, isn&#39;t that better? So, which wheels would you like for your wagon – those old ones that snap sure as daybreak or these nice, soft, pliable ones?&quot;

[[I&#39;d like to purchase the soft, green wheels for added comfort.-&gt;buynewwheels1]]

[[I&#39;d like to purchase the old, dried out wheels.-&gt;buyoldwheels1]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="buynewwheels1" tags="nofooterhere1" position="1975,3200" size="200,100">&quot;Excellent choice! See, most people coming through here ain&#39;t got a lick of sense about &#39;em. But you, you, I knew you had a good head on you. Alright, now that we have the wheels, lets find you the best wagon.&quot; 

[[Pick out a wagon.-&gt;pickoutthewagon1]]{(set:$wheelcondition to 2)}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="buyoldwheels1" tags="nofooterhere1" position="2225,3200" size="200,100">Mr. Lang was clearly disappointed. He repeatedly sighed as he shook his head in dismay. I heard him mumbling, &quot;Try to help out one of these city folks, and what do they do? They turn on you, that&#39;s what. Try to give &#39;em some advice on how to make it across the prairie and are they grateful? No, of course, they&#39;re not. Same thing day after day. Ungrateful lot, all of &#39;em.&quot; Eventually, he scoffed and looked at me. 

&quot;Alright, I suppose,&quot; he said, &quot;we&#39;d better get you finished up here. Let&#39;s get your wagon picked out. Remember, if you change your mind, you can come back in here and I&#39;ll switch out your  mistakes for some of those new wheels.&quot;{(set:$wheelcondition to 1)}

I should have practiced more.

Everyone else seemed to be having similar problems, so I don’t feel too bad. Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[ Taylor kept yelling at us to hurry up. He said he’s never seen such a bunch of lazy, know-nothings. You could hear his voice ordering people what to do. He even yelled at me a few times. I don’t think he understands that I was doing the best I can do. I’ve never done this before.(set:$morale to $morale -3)]

(if: $captain is 2)[ Hutchins went to everyone while it was still very early. The sun wasn’t even up, but he was still smiling and joking with everyone. He helped people out and encouraged us to work together. We started out a little after dawn, but Captain Hutchins told us we were all doing a great job. He said he knows that we have likely never done this before. I’m looking forward to seeing what will happen on this first day of this great adventure. (set:$morale to $morale +2)]

(if: $captain is 3)[ Powell moved from family to family saying little but giving guidance where it was most needed. A lot of the families started helping each other get ready.

(if: $captain is 2)[It took us a little longer to get on the trail than we wanted today, but, all in all, it was a good day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a little confusion early this morning when we weren’t sure what the order of wagons was supposed to be. Captain Hutchins rode up and made a few quick corrections. The sun came out before noon and then some (either: &quot;high &quot;,&quot;&quot;)clouds eased across the sky by the (either: &quot;early&quot;,&quot;late&quot;) afternoon. We made it (either: &quot;eight&quot;,&quot;nine&quot;,&quot;ten&quot;) miles today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were able to make camp shortly before sunset.

(if: $captain is 3)[We got off to a slow start. Captain Powell seemed a bit aggravated that it was taking so long to get the wagons ready.

While this kept it cool, which was nice as we were all sweating by the time wthe sun as above the horizon, it made the day feel (either: &quot;gloomy&quot;,&quot;bleak&quot;,&quot;dismal&quot;,&quot;dreary&quot;,&quot;somber&quot;). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We made it (either: &quot;six&quot;,&quot;seven&quot;,&quot;eight&quot;) miles today.

We paused by Mr. John Bartleston’s farm in Little Sante Fe, Missouri around (either: &quot;noon&quot;,&quot;one o’clock&quot;,&quot;two o’clock&quot;,&quot;nine o’clock&quot;,&quot;ten o’clock&quot;,&quot;eleven o’clock&quot;) today. It was nice to get a short break.

Once we moved out, we officially entered into the Nebraska Territory or the Kansas Territory. It depends on who you’re talking to. I&#39;ve also heard it called Indian Territory, so I don&#39;t actually know where I&#39;m at right now. Not that it matters much. There’s some talk about whether this territory should enter the Union as a Free or Slave state. 

I expected that civilization would stop where the Trail started, but I was wrong. There are still farms and small villages out this way. 

The land is not quite as flat as I thought it would be. It is more like gently rolling low hills. There are rocks here and there, but mostly it is just grass. Lots and lots of grass. Basically, no matter what direction you look, it is grass punctuated with lines of trees where they border streams and rivers. There are very few trees away from the water.

Tomorrow, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} wants to make it out to where the Oregon and Sante Fe Trails splits.

This morning we passed the road to Sante Fe. We turned at a faded marker that says, &quot;Road to Oregon.&quot; There was a lot of shouting and hooting as we made the right turn towards the Kansas river and out west! 

We’ve gone about 40 miles since leaving Independence, Missouri. 

A wagon got tipped sideways today. We’re not quite sure how it happened, but Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor was livid. At one point, I thought he was going to hit the driver.(set:$morale to $morale -2)]

We pulled the wagons into a circle and drove all the livestock into the middle. This keeps them from running away (or being stolen). Some family members unhitched their animals while others started a fire and began making dinner. Sooner or later, someone would start playing a fiddle. Sometimes people would even sing. Usually, small groups of people would get together to pray or read their Bible.

After I got our tent set up and bedroll ready, I made my way over to some of those talking by a campfire.

&quot;(either: &quot;Howdy,&quot;,&quot;Evening,&quot;,&quot;Hello there,&quot;,&quot;How’s it going?&quot;,&quot;Well, that was a long day,&quot;)&quot; I said as I (either: &quot;sat down&quot;,&quot;strolled over&quot;,&quot;walked up&quot;), (either: &quot;slowing chewing on&quot;,&quot;eating&quot;,&quot;nibbling on&quot;) some (either: &quot;biscuits&quot;,&quot;rolls&quot;,&quot;bacon&quot;,&quot;beans&quot;,&quot;hardtack&quot;,&quot;pie&quot;).

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} was already sitting there. &quot;(either: &quot;Good evening&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;,&quot;Nice of you to join us&quot;),&quot; he said. 

We made small talk for a while, and then I asked a question that (either: &quot;had been on my mind&quot;,&quot;I’d been thinking about for days&quot;,&quot;I was a bit worried about&quot;,&quot;I’d been wondering about&quot;).

&quot;I know this may sound (either: &quot;silly&quot;,&quot;ridiculous&quot;,&quot;strange&quot;,&quot;odd&quot;), I started, &quot;but I’ve heard that Indians can be a problem while we’re on the prairie. Is that true?&quot;

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor scoffed. &quot;No. They aren’t a problem unless you go out of your way to bother them. They’re basically harmless. Now, if we were going through Comanche or Apache territory, then it’d be a different story. They don’t take too much to people moving through their lands. Out here, though, no, you don’t have anything to worry about.]
(if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins smiled. &quot;No, you don’t have to worry about Indians. We have good relations with just about everyone on the prairie. As a matter of fact, we’ll likely trade with them. We might even hire some to scout for us if we need to leave the main trail. So, the Indians are friendly.&quot;]
(if: $captain is 3)[Powell said, &quot;No. They are not a problem.&quot;]}

&quot;I’d heard the story of Cynthia Ann Parker. I heard her family had been killed and she had been captured by Comanches in the mid-1830s.&quot;

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} nodded. &quot;That’s actually a true story,&quot; he said, &quot;but it is exceptionally rare. I’m sure what you heard was probably from those dime novels. They always make things out to be bigger than real life. That won’t happen where we’re going. We’re safe.&quot; 

I nodded. I was relieved to hear that. I had a feeling the stories I had heard were exaggerated.

&quot;So, do you have any other questions?&quot;

Even though it rained most of the day, we were able to rest. 

I repacked most of the wagon. Over the last few days, I’ve learned what worked and what didn’t. I’ve taken the time to check all the nuts and bolts. I’ve tightened down the canvas. I’ve greased the axles. Basically, I tried to get everything in the best condition I can.

At one point, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[ Taylor came by and managed to find something wrong with everything I was doing.(set:$morale to $morale -2)]
(if: $captain is 2)[ Hutchins stopped by and helped me out for a little while. He gave me a few pointers that made things easier.(set:$morale to $morale +1)]
(if: $captain is 3)[ Powell was walking by, stopped for moment, looked at what I was doing, nodded, and moved on.(set:$morale to $morale -1)]}

I’ve been able to spend a little more time getting to know a few of the families traveling in this company.

{(if: $captain is 1)[The Dunns’ are particularly nice. James and his wife, Mary, lived in Boston for a few years and have decided to try their luck out in California. They have three children, aged five, six, and nine. All girls.]
(if: $captain is 2)[The McAlister’s are very friendly and offer to help with anything. Kristine and her brother, Johannes, are taking their nephew, aged eleven, out to meet the rest of their extended family in The City of the Great Salt Lake.]
(if: $captain is 3)[The Washburn’s are very knowledgeable. Hans, Emma, and their two sons, aged fifteen and seventeen have actually made this trip twice before – once going west and once going east. When I asked why they did so, they said they enjoyed the adventure. They said they made the first trip with just the husband and wife. They set up their homestead and came back to get their sons who were staying with their grandparents. Now, the whole family will be able to settle out west.]}

(either: &quot;While I was setting up my tent, I noticed something shiny in the grass. Turns out, it was 4 quarters just sitting there waiting for me to come alone.(set:$money to $money +1)(set:$morale to $morale +1)&quot;,&quot;I&#39;m getting pretty good at setting up camp.&quot;)

I don&#39;t know why, but it really struck me today that I&#39;m actually doing this - I&#39;m really moving west in a covered wagon!

Is that it? Well, let me tell you. First, and foremost we need to make sure our animals are safe. So, we need an area big enough to keep ‘em all contained. We can drive ‘em up into a box canyon, but we won’t see any of those for a long time. So, we need an area big enough to circle our wagons. The area should be as level as possible. We also want to choose a spot that is as easy as possible to defend. Ideally, we camp next to a stream or river with a concave bend with deep, swift water. That way, we can only be attacked from one direction.&quot;(set: $morale to $morale - 1)]
(if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins said, &quot;Well, we want to choose a spot as close to where we’re traveling as possible. I hate having to go a few miles out of the way to find a suitable place. What we’re looking for is a level area with as few thickets of brush and trees as possible. If we can use a bend in the river to set up camp, that is easiest. If you have an abrupt hill or cliff, that works as well. Pull the wagons close together in a circle to allow for the sheltering of the animals. We’ll set up the tents on the side that is most exposed to the prairie. This way, we can keep sentries on watch to make sure our animals stay safe and can’t run away.&quot;(set: $morale to $morale + 1)]

It is only through laziness and ignorance of the people watching them that animals get up a head steam to stampede. A stampede is one of the worst things to happen to a wagon company. Some of your animals might get killed or become lame which is just as bad. If that happens, you’ll be stuck on the prairie and have to rely on hope and strangers.&quot;]
(if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins said, &quot;Stampedes can be a real problem on the plains. Animals might be killed or run off across the prairie. Either way, and the company is in danger. Without our animals, we might not be able to move our wagons or have a reliable source of meat. To help prevent this, we make sure the animals are encircled by the wagons at the end of the each day. If, and when, a stampede happens, the best thing to do is to have our picket guards be ready with some saddled horses nearby. This way the pickets can quickly mount, and get the herd to turn back toward the camp. Generally, this helps to quiet their alarm. Above all, don’t panic. Keep your wits about you and you’ll be able to save most if not all of the animals.&quot;]
(if: $captain is 3)[Powell titled his hat back and smiled. &quot;I don’t know if you know this or not but before I became a captain of this company, I was a ranch hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Stampedes are a serious problem on these wide open grasslands. If a herd gets up much steam, there’s really no stopping ‘em. They can run for miles and miles before they slow on their own. So, the trick is to make sure you’re ready for a stampede at any time. Now, when we’re moseying along pulling wagons, there isn’t much threat. It is at night that you must be most watchful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Anything can scare a herd into jumping, thunder, heavy rain, even a strong wind might do it. We also have to be watchful of people trying to steal our stock. They might sneak in, make a mad dash, and get the animals spooked. If that happens, they’ll bolt. So, having some men on horses watching throughout the night is your best defense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;If the herd runs, you get a strong mare in front of them to guide them. They’ll follow her. Then push on the side opposite the direction of the camp. In this way, the herd will slowly turn. When the animals see the camp, they will almost always calm down and stop running.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Does that answer your question?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;(set: $morale to $morale + 3)]}

(if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins nodded his head several times before saying, &quot;That’s a great question. Most people don’t really think about that stuff but it is really important. Generally speaking, we try to stay away from rivers and lakes surrounded by heavy timber or thick vegetation. Those areas seem to produce a lot of decomposition and miasma. So, naturally, we avoid camping in those places if we can avoid it. We don’t always have a choice, but when we do, we move away from there. We also know that most diseases can be found near the muddy banks of larger rivers, near ponds and swamps, and in areas that have had all their trees recently timbered. There is also an idea that stagnant air can also be places to avoid. So, we try to avoid areas with still area like inside forests or thickets.&quot;(set: $morale to $morale + 1)]

In the early afternoon, we made it to Captain Creek. Normally, it would be easy to cross over, but because of all the rain, it had swollen up a bit and was running fast.

Late in the day, we made it to the Wakarusa River. It was lined on both banks with trees and bushes. Off to the south, we could see a large bluish colored mound rising above the prairie. I&#39;m told this is one of the last geologic features we&#39;ll see for a while.

{(if: $captain is 1)[Captain Taylor brought us up to the edge of the river. The river was swollen and flowing fast from all the recent rain. He said he’s seen worse. He wanted to cross here as this was the fastest way. We could try to go upstream for miles and miles, but it would be just as bad up there and would take us hours and hours out of our way. He said he would leave it up to us, but he’d rather just ford the river here.]
(if: $captain is 2)[Captain Hutchins halted the wagon train and called everyone forward. He explained that normally, we would just ford the river. He explained that it normally isn’t that deep or swift, but with all the rain we’ve had recently, he’s worried about the risk being too high. He said we could ford the river here or we can go upstream six or seven miles to see if it is any better. He said going the long way is not a guarantee to be any better, but it might be safer even though it will take us hours out of the way. He recommends we take the safer route.]
(if: $captain is 3)[At the edge of the river, Captain Powell halted the wagon train. After twenty minutes or so, I made my way up toward him. He stood on the bank of the river.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn’t that wide, maybe 50 feet or so, but it was flowing swiftly. When I asked what we were going to do, Captain Powell hesitated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He looked at the current, at the rain coming from the heavy clouds overhead, and then at the wagons. He kept chewing on his lips as he paced back and forth. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;we can either cross here or try to go upstream. What do you think we should do?&quot;]}

I looked at the river closely. It was muddy and had a lot of debris. Sticks and logs were passing by quickly. I looked upstream, but I could only see a few hundred feet before the river went around a bend.

The trail was not as established and we had a hard time getting through all the ruts and bumps. The continuous rain didn’t make it any easier.

Every quarter-mile or so, we’d check to see if the river was any easier to cross. We couldn’t find a better place and eventually, we started entering into a swampy wetland area. Further west, it looked even more boggy. So, we turned the wagons northward and approached the river in the best place we could find. 

The river was not quite as wide here, maybe only 25 feet or so, and the water wasn’t flowing quite as fast. A few riders went forward to see how deep it was. Fortunately, the water barely reached the horses’ bellies. 

So, we decided to cross here.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor was clearly frustrated that we spent hours making our way upstream. He kept complaining about how we would have saved ourselves a lot of time and backaches if we had just crossed the river where we were hours ago. He ordered the wagons forward, and we were able to cross without many problems. It did take us until evening to get everyone across, but everyone was safe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, even though we’re all a little sore, bruised, and muddy from pushing the wagons through the marshy ground, we’re all safe, so, all in all, it was a good day.

We made camp a few miles north of the Wakarusa and about a half-mile south of the Kansas River. There are a few squatters house scattered about, (either: &quot;but we didn’t speak with anybody.&quot;,&quot;and we spoke briefly with two brothers who had set up a small farm. They said they&#39;d seen more and more people heading west and it might be better for them to set up a general store than a farm.&quot;,&quot;but we didn&#39;t see anyone about.&quot;,&quot;and we breifly spoke with a young family.

From camp, our course was generally westward. We passed just south of some jumbled-up land – steep and narrow hills closer to the river. We had to drive the wagons over a few of the smaller hillocks now and again, but it wasn’t too difficult, especially now that it wasn&#39;t raining on us. 

At one point, we were up on a little rise, and I saw the waters of the Kaw or Kansas River. It looked to be about six or seven hundred feet across. Muddy brown with trees mostly on the northern shore. Much larger than anything we&#39;d see while in the wagons so far. Of course, the Mississippi was much larger, but that was many miles and a lifetime behind me now.

We covered more miles than usual today. I know each mile we cover is one closer to my destination. 

Also, I should mention that Mr. Gaines, the former ranch hand, produced a small jug of whiskey from somewhere. (if: ($gender is 1))[I thought it was nice of him to share, but someone must have gone and told on him. It wasn&#39;t ten minutes before Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} came up and {(if: $captain is 1)[demanded to know](if: $captain is 2)[asked](if: $captain is 3)[wanted to know]} what was going on. When he found out about the alcohol, he told Mr. Gaines that he was in violation of the company&#39;s bylaws and would therefor be assigned one extra hour of night watch for a period of two weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally, I thought this was a bit harsh, but I guess it means no one else will produce any more.](if: ($gender is 2))[Of course, some of the men got drunk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} somehow heard about it. Of course, it was too late as some men were already intoxicated. Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} ordered Mr. Gaines and anyone who participated to one extra hour of night watch for one week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally, I don&#39;t think the punishment is hard enough for someone who broke the company&#39;s bylaws we all signed, but maybe it will be enough to disuade the others from doing something like this again.]

When you didn&#39;t send word that you made it out west, your extended family grew worried.

They did what they could to find what happened to you, but they never discover anything. Perhaps you&#39;re buried in one of the thousands of trail graves. Perhaps you went back east in shame and never spoke to them. 

The world will never know.

He said, &#39;Papan’s Ferry&#39; is the best way to cross the Kansas River and traffic can get backed up for miles.&quot; I didn’t understand what he meant until a few hours later. 

As we got closer to where we would cross, I saw what seemed like hundreds of wagons waiting ahead of us. The canvas tops of the wagons made a long line of white dots stretching toward the river. I couldn&#39;t quite tell, but it looked as if there was a thick cluster of wagons close to one spot on the southern shore of the river.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} rode by all the wagons and said, &quot;Just settle in. This could easily take to nightfall.&quot;

I didn’t understand why until I realized that the water was too wide and deep to try to ford like we did with Captain Creek and the Wakarusa River. A few wagons from another company had tried to float their wagons across, but they ended up capsizing and sinking. A few people had even drowned.

So, we waited.

While we wait, I could use this time wisely.

I waved to a few of the others as I made my way toward a low gully. One man shouted out, &quot;This areas been hunted out but good luck.&quot;

(either: &quot;I made my way into the gully and then sat next to a tree for a while, just listening and looking. It was actually quite peaceful. After some time, I saw a raccoon make its way into a small clearing. He was a big fellow, too. I eased up my rifle, lined him up, and fired. He dropped immediately. When I walked back to the wagon, I held it up high so the man could see the area wasn&#39;t completely hunted out.(set: $food to $food + 4)(set: $morale to $morale + 1)&quot;,&quot;I slowly made my way into the gully.

Maybe next time.&quot;,&quot;I worked my way carefully through the grass but I never saw so much as a mouse. Maybe next time.&quot;,&quot;I spent quite a while sneaking through the grass but didn&#39;t see one living thing. Looks like he was right, this area has been hunted out. Maybe next time.&quot;)
 
As I made my way back up out of the little gully, I saw Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} riding up the line of our wagon train. We must be getting ready to move toward the ferry.

While there wasn&#39;t exactly a lot going on while we rode, you still had to watch out for rocks, ruts, and other things that might cause the wagon to get into a trouble.

So, I made my way over to the {(if: $captain is 1)[Dunns Family](if: $captain is 2)[McAlister Family](if: $captain is 3)[Washburn Family]}. I usually had dinner and breakfast with them. Sometimes, if we stopped midday, I would also spend a bit of time then as well. 

{(if: $gender is 1) + (if: $captain is 1)[Mr. James Dunns climbed down off his wagon to greet me.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;How&#39;s it going, (if: $gender is 1)[sir]? Can you believe all these wagons just waiting to cross?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I know. I wasn&#39;t expecting this many,&quot; I replied. &quot;You&#39;d think they would have more ferries set up, but then again, I don&#39;t know anything about how all the works.&quot; We stood and watched as the wagons slowly inched their way closer to the river. &quot;So, you said you&#39;re planning on settling out in Oregon City?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;That&#39;s right. I have a distant cousin who went out there a few years ago. He wrote the family and told us that the Willamette Valley is straight from your dreams. He said the land is green, the waters are pure, and the climate is mild. He wrote that if you so much as dropped a seed on the ground, it would sprout.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Sounds a bit like heaven.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Exactly,&quot; he said, nodding vigorously. &quot;Well, it took us a bit more than a year to save up enough money and close up our affairs in Boston, but here we are.&quot; He looked at the gently hills slowly dipping down toward the Kansas River.

I moved off to the south and up a very gentle hill. The grasses reached to the horizon. Long lines of trees would make their way down many gullies and ditches.

The weather was nice. Birds were singing. The sun felt good. Quite simply, it was relaxing.

I don&#39;t know how long I was walking, but eventually I saw Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} riding up the line of our wagon train. We must be getting ready to move toward the ferry.

As we got closer to the river, I was surprised to see there were actually quite a few buildings. They were single room log cabins or sod houses. 

Next to one log cabin, a man and a woman were speaking with the driver of each wagon as it approached the river. It took my a while to eventually make it to them.

&quot;Salut,&quot; the man said. &quot;My name is Joseph Papan. This is my lovely wife, Josette.&quot; She curtsied. &quot;We run the best and only ferry across the Kaw. En tout cas, if you want for us to ferry you across the river, it will cost you (print: (cond: ($wagonweight &lt;2000),&quot;one dollar.(set:$money to it -1)&quot;,(($wagonweight &gt;= 2000) and (($wagonweight &lt; 2500))), &quot;two dollars.(set:$money to it -2)&quot;, (($wagonweight &gt;= 2500) and (($wagonweight &lt; 3000))), &quot;three dollars.(set:$money to it -3)&quot;, (($wagonweight &gt;= 3000) and (($wagonweight &lt; 3500))), &quot;four dollars.(set:$money to it -4)&quot;, (($wagonweight &gt;= 3500) and (($wagonweight &lt; 10000))), &quot;five dollars.(set:$money to it -5)&quot;))&quot;
 
{I paid Mr. Papan knowing that I didn&#39;t have much choice. (print: (cond: ($money &lt;20),&quot;I only have $[|moneyStat&gt;[$money]] left. If I&#39;m not very careful, I will run out of money. I&#39;ll have to find a way to make some money while on the trail. I need to think about it.&quot;,

I know the trail is still long and I&#39;ll likely have to spend money on repairs and food, but if I am very careful, I might just make it.

 (($money &gt;= 180) and (($money &lt; 300))), &quot;I have $[|moneyStat&gt;[$money]]. I know I still have a long way to go, so I don&#39;t want to spend my money like it is growing on trees, but I&#39;m not too worried. Maybe I can find a way to make a little money while on the trail.

 ($money &gt;= 300), &quot;I have $[|moneyStat&gt;[$money]]. I think I&#39;ve saved up enough for this trip. I was worried about running out of money before I made it out west, but unless something terrible happens, I should be alright. Never-the-less, there might be some ways I can make a little money while on the trail. I&#39;ll have to think about it.&quot;
 ))}
 
I waited another few minutes for one of the two ferrys to make it back to the shore. Each ferry could carry two wagons and animals. The men, as it turns out, are all brothers. These two are called Ahcan and Louis. They  greeted me and help me board the little ferry. We made small talk until we reached the northern side of the Kansas River. I learned that the brothers and their wives had moved here about a decade ago and had been running the ferry service almost as long. 

As they used long poles to push the ferry over the water, they talked about how their earliest customers were soldiers going from Fort Leavenworth to New Mexico. They also had a lot of miners, trappers, missionaries, and settlers among their clientele. 

Before I knew it, I was unloading on the far short. I thanked them and turned to wagon toward tonight&#39;s campsite.

Dear Diary,

I was able to finally get the broken wheel replaced. It is an experience I will never forget and, hopefully, will never have to repeat.

The problem is the wagon still weights about [|weightStat&gt;[$wagonweight]] pounds. I know I am supposed to keep it around 2,000 pounds. The more weight I put on it, the more likely it will break down again. The closer I am to the max weight of 4,000 pounds, the greater the chance something will break.

So, now I am faced with a tough choice. Do I keep going without throwing anything to the side of the trail and risk breaking down again, or do I throw some things away to lighten the load? 

[[I hate to do it, but I&#39;ve decided to throw some things to the side of the trail.-&gt;stilloverloaded1b]]

[[I&#39;ve decided to keep going with the overloaded wagon and hope I get lucky.-&gt;backtothestory1]]

Dear Diary,

There is a small community set up here. It is based primarily around a church. I think they are Baptists, but I haven&#39;t asked. There is also a small blacksmith shop and a very small market setup here. Quite a few people are going over to see if they can get repairs done, improve some little system they have on their wagon, or pick up some last minute supplies.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} rode up to my wagon. &quot;If you need anything done, repairs or whatnot, I recommend you get it done here as it is harder to find a blacksmith further to the west. It is also lot more expensive.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;re about two hundred miles from the next place you&#39;re really be able to get any supplies,&quot; he said as he looked over my wagon. &quot;We might pass by another small church here or there, but Fort Kearey is two weeks away.&quot; He rode his horse slowly around the wagon, looking in, under, and on it.  (if: $waterbarrel &lt; 2)[&quot;I recommend you pick up another water barrel before too much longer. If you run out of water, you won&#39;t last more than a day or two out there on the prairie.&quot;] He paused a moment to open the back flap of canvas. (if: $food &lt; 70)[&quot;I see you don&#39;t have a lot of food. I recommend at least 70 pounds. That way, if we run into delays, you won&#39;t have to go on emergency rations.&quot; ] He rode up next to me and looked me up and down. (if: $medicalkits &lt; 1)[&quot;I highly encourage you to pick up at least one medical kit. You never know what might happen out there and it is better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it if you know what I mean.&quot; ]Before he rode away, he looked at my animals. (else:)[&quot;Alright, it looks like you&#39;re ready for the trip.&quot;]

He moved off to the next wagon.

(if:$gender is 1)[He](if:$gender is 2)[She] pointed a little way off to the south. &quot;You see that lake?&quot; (if:$gender is 1)[he asked.](if:$gender is 2)[she asked.] It was a narrow and curved lake, much like the letter &#39;U&#39; or &#39;C.&#39;

I nodded. 

&quot;Do you know what that&#39;s called?&quot;

I shook my head.

&quot;Its called an oxbow lake.&quot; (if:$gender is 1)[He](if:$gender is 2)[She] smiled. &quot;See, when I was young, my grandfather took me on a hike. I saw one just like that and asked him if he knew what it was. &#39;Sure,&#39; my granfather said, &#39;That&#39;s a baby river. All rivers start out small like that. When they get stronger and old, they will meander off to a far away land. Then, when they are ready, they will have little baby rivers.&#39; He laughed and laughed when I though he was serious.

Years later and I saw a painting by Thomas Cole. It reminded me of my grandfather, who has since passed on. I liked that painting so much, I bought a copy and have been carrying it with me on the trail so I can have it with me out west. Here, you can look for yourself.&quot; With that, (if:$gender is 1)[he](if:$gender is 2)[she] handed me a small, rolled up canvas paper. When I opened it, I was amazed.

&lt;div class=&quot; oxbowpaintingimage&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&quot;Of course,&quot; (if:$gender is 1)[he said](if:$gender is 2)[she said], &quot;When I was older, I learned that those oxbow lakes form over a long period of time. In the past, the river used to make its way up and around the corner. At some point though, the curve in the river got so bent that it folded back in on itself. When that happened, the river didn&#39;t need to take the long way around. So, it stopped flowing through the curvy part. What used to be river, became a lake.&quot;

I thanked (if: $gender is 1)[{(if: $captain is 1)[James for sharing, and he walked back toward his wagon.](if: $captain is 2)[Johannes for sharing, and he walked back toward his wagon.](if: $captain is 3)[Hans for sharing, and he walked back toward his wagon.]}](else:)[{(if: $captain is 1)[Mary for sharing, and she walked back toward his wagon.](if: $captain is 2)[Kristine or sharing, and she walked back toward his wagon.](if: $captain is 3)[Emma or sharing, and she walked back toward his wagon.]}]

I smiled to myself imaging (if:$gender is 1)[him](if:$gender is 2)[her] being told that story as a small child.

I noticed the wagons started to move toward the west.

After parking the wagon, I made my way toward some buildings made with logs and sod. A priest, by the look of his clothes, and two Indians walked towards me.

The priest was young, perhaps in his thirties. The two Indians were both tall and lean. They wore deerskin breechcloths, leggings, and shirts. One had a simply adorned leather headband.

&quot;Good afternoon. My name is Father Thomas Green.&quot; We shook hands. &quot;Welcome to our Jesuit Mission. I am here fill the hearts of the Faithful and kindle in them the fire of God&#39;s Love. How may I be of service?&quot;

&quot;It is nice to meet you.

&quot;Bozho nikan. Noswen Beshkno. Nikan Senajewen. Nitthe eshnekasyen?&quot;

&quot;He says hello. This is Bald Eagle,&quot; Fr. Green said, motioning to the man with the headband, &quot;and his brother, Swift Water. He wants to know your name.&quot;

&quot;My name is (print: $charactername1).&quot; I nodded toward Bald Eagle. &quot;Are you from around here?&quot;

The priest translated my question and the Indian&#39;s response. 

&quot;No, he said, he is from east of the Mississippi. He was forced out here when he was twelve. He walked the Trail of Death. One hundred sixty of his people and one of my fellow priests, Fr. Petit, died before they made completed the journey.&quot;

&quot;I had no idea that happened. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

The priest translated and the Indian stared at me, unblinking.

&quot;So, I know you just passed by the church, but do you need anything? We have very few supplies here. We are a mission and not an outpost, but we have some food and some water. If you&#39;re making your way out west, I recommend at least forty pounds of food for each person in your wagon. That should get you to Fort Kearney. If you can carry more, I recommend it.&quot;

I thanked them for the opporutnity to buy food, water, and medical supplies.

Bald Eagle walked over to me. &quot;Bama mine gwabmen.&quot;

&quot;He said goodbye,&quot; the priest translated.

&quot;Please tell him it was nice to meet him. Thank him for the information. Thank you for your offer of supplies.&quot;

The priest translated and then paused. &quot;Have you seen the elephant yet?&quot; he asked.

I paused. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Has anything bad happened yet?&quot;

&quot;What does that have to do with an elephant?&quot;

The blacksmith chuckled. &quot;It is a metaphor. I means that bad things will likely happen on your trip, but you&#39;ll still get to where you&#39;re going. Sort of like, &#39;Yeah, that was bad, but at least I got to see the elephant.&#39;&quot;

I nodded in understanding. &quot;Yes, I think we&#39;ve alrady seen at least one elephant.&quot;

&quot;Safe travels out there,&quot; he said and waved goodbye.

&quot;A bolt of brilliant lightning stuck the ground not ten feet from the wagon. I nearly jumped out of my skin. I&#39;ve never been so scared.&quot;,
&quot;A bolt of thunder almost made the animals stampede. I&#39;m glad some trusty men were able to get it stopped despite the deluge of rain.&quot;,
&quot;A bright flash of lightning struck a tree nearby, lighting it on fire. It split it almost in half.&quot;,
&quot;A clap of thunder made me almost jump out of my skin. It must have hit within a few yards of the wagon. I can&#39;t wait for this stop to pass.&quot;,
&quot;A flash of lightning struck a horse and rider. Both were killed instantly. I pray that this stop will stop before much longer.&quot;,

&quot;A thunderbolt hit one of the wagons in the company. It briefly caught on fire. They were able to put it out and no one was seriously hurt but it sure scared us all near to death.&quot;,
&quot;A thunderclap made me almost jump out of my skin. It must have hit within a few yards of the wagon. I can&#39;t wait for this stop to pass.&quot;,
&quot;All day long, lightning flashed across the angry sky. I lost count of how many bolts I saw. Back home, we never had storms like this. I want it to be over.&quot;,
&quot;All day long, streaks of lightning flashed across the sky.&quot;,
&quot;All day long, the dark sky flashed with lightning, and the trail rolled with near constant thunder.&quot;,
&quot;All day long, we faced a furious storm. For a while, I didn&#39;t think anyone would live to tell the tale.&quot;,
&quot;All day long, we heard bang after band of thunder roll over the trail as lightning flashed across the sky.&quot;,
&quot;All day long, we heard booming thunder.&quot;,
&quot;All day long, we we.re rattled with thunder.&quot;,
&quot;All day long, we were rattled with earth-shaking thunder.&quot;,
&quot;&#39;Circa regna tonat – it thunders around the realm!&#39;&quot;,
&quot;&#39;Fear no more the lightning-flash, nor the all-dread thunder-stone.&quot;,
&quot;For hours, we heard nothing but clap of thunder rolling over the trail and the rain pelting the wagons.&quot;,
&quot;For hours, we heard nothing but the crack of thunder and the rain pelting the wagons.&quot;,

&quot;For hours, we heard nothing but the crash of thunder and the rain pelting the wagons.&quot;,
&quot;I didn&#39;t know it could rain so heavily. This rain is unbelievable.&quot;,
&quot;It is after Freyr himself was out there trying to strike the wagon with his thunderbolts.&quot;,
&quot;It is after Jupiter himself was out there trying to strike the wagon with his thunderbolts.&quot;,
&quot;It is after Thor himself was out there trying to strike the wagon with his thunderbolts.&quot;,
&quot;It is after Zeus himself was out there trying to strike the wagon with his thunderbolts.&quot;,
&quot;It is like the gates of heaven opened up and the land is going to be flooded again. I&#39;ve never seen rain like this before.&quot;,
&quot;&#39;Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.&#39;&quot;,
&quot;This is the heaviest rainfall I&#39;ve ever seen. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single dry spot anywhere in the wagon or on me.&quot;,
&quot;This is the worst rain I&#39;ve ever seen. I didn&#39;t know it could rain this hard.&quot;,
&quot;This rain reminds me of John Clare&#39;s &#39;The Thunder Mutters&#39; -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thunder mutters louder &amp; more loud&lt;br&gt;With quicker motion hay folks ply the rake&lt;br&gt;Ready to burst slow sails the pitch black cloud&lt;br&gt;&amp; all the gang a bigger haycock make&lt;br&gt;To sit beneath—the woodland winds awake&lt;br&gt; The drops so large wet all thro’ in an hour&lt;br&gt;A tiney flood runs down the leaning rake&lt;br&gt;In the sweet hay yet dry the hay folks cower&lt;br&gt;&amp; some beneath the waggon shun the shower.&quot;,

If you&#39;d been here a few days ago, you&#39;d have your pick of the litter. Alas, this is all we have left.&quot;

I walked among the wagons, inspecting each on carefully.

&quot;So, are you looking for a particular kind? You seem to be interested in the details.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking for one that will get me across the country. Most of these won&#39;t make it across town.&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon, (if: $gender is 1)[sir](if: $gender is 2)[ma&#39;am]. These are some of the most reliable wagons in all of Missouri. I&#39;d stake my reputation on that.&quot;

&quot;Forgive me. I didn&#39;t properly introduce myself. I&#39;ve been a wainwright my whole life. I see what you&#39;ve done to make these run down carts look presentable.&quot;

Mr. Lang&#39;s smile faded.

&quot;I&#39;m not here to ruffle your feathers, but don&#39;t expect me to pay full price for what you have left in your yard.&quot;

&quot;Of course not. I&#39;ll tell you what, you take your time, pick out the one you want, then come inside and see me. I can&#39;t give it away, but I&#39;m sure we can come to equitable terms. Is that acceptable, (if: $gender is 1)[sir](if: $gender is 2)[ma&#39;am]?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

Half an hour later, I approached Mr. Lang.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Mr. Lang said, &quot;what have you decided?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve narrowed it down to these three.&quot; I pointed at the ones I liked. &quot;Tell me about them.&quot;

&quot;Of course. The first one is a 3 1/2 by 9 feet. While it can&#39;t hold quite as much, it is a little lighter and easier to drive. I recommend you keep the weight under fifteen hundred pounds, but you already know that. 

&quot;The second is your standard sized wagon. Its bed is 4 by 10 feet. So, you&#39;ll have a little extra room to store things. The seat is new, so you&#39;ll have a bit more comfort while on the trail. It is strong, light, and made of well-seasoned timber. Still, I recommend you keep the weight under two thousand pounds. 

&quot;That last one there is the biggest one I still have. It is 4 by 12 feet. So, if you&#39;re looking for some extra storage space, this is the one I recommend. It can easily handle twenty-five hundred pounds. It has reinforced framing so it can handle a few more bumps while on the trail. 

&quot;So, which one would you like?&quot;

I thought for a moment.

&quot;It will?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely! See here, it&#39;s got all the parts you&#39;ll ever need.&quot;

&quot;It does?&quot;

&quot;Well, sure,&quot; he said, talking ever more rapidly. &quot;We&#39;ll start here, you&#39;ve got your wagon bed (nice and big, ain&#39;t it?), sideboards, brake block, jockey box, falling tongue, double tree, single tree, neck yoke (for them nice oxen you brought with you), front and rear wheels, iron tires (for durability, of course), the cover, or as like to call, the bonnet, (that&#39;ll keep the sun from beating down on ya – sure, we can get that sewn up before you go), staples and bows (of course, we can replace that one – someone should&#39;ve already done that – I&#39;ll have to speak with Micha about this), strap bolts, and underneath here, you got your hounds and reach, the bolster (now tell me that ain&#39;t made of solid stuff), the axle and axle assembly, hub, felly rim, fellows, the grease bucket, the coupling pin, the cross arms, and last but not least, the water barrel (for when you&#39;d like a nice cool drink).&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Mr. Lang said, &quot;these are the three best wagons I still have. 

&quot;The first one is a bit on the smaller side. The bed of this wagon is 3 1/2 by 9 feet. While it can&#39;t hold quite as much, it is a little lighter and easier to drive. I recommend you keep the weight under fifteen hundred pounds. You can rest assured that this is a good wagon - it has already been out to Fort Bridger and back. 

&quot;The second wagon is your standard sized wagon. Its bed is 4 by 10 feet. So, you&#39;ll have a little extra room to store things. The seat is new, so you&#39;ll have a bit more comfort while on the trail(if: (history:) contains &quot;buynewwheels1&quot;)[ especially with those new wheels](if: (history:) contains &quot;buyoldwheels1&quot;)[ but you&#39;d be a lot more comfortable with the new, green wheels]. It is strong, light, and made of well-seasoned timber. Still, I recommend you keep the weight under two thousand pounds. 

&quot;The last one is the biggest one I still have. It is 4 by 12 feet. So, if you&#39;re looking for some extra storage space, this is the one I recommend. It can easily handle twenty-five hundred pounds. It has reinforced framing so it can handle a few more bumps while on the trail. As you can see, it comes with an advanced breaking system. It might be a little heaver than the others, but it is quite strong. The biggest downside with this one is it means more work for your oxen. 

&quot;So, which one would you like?&quot;

Dear Diary,

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel2&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel2&quot;)

We ended up staying at St. Marys for a second day. 

Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] said some of the wagons needed a few repairs before we got started. He wanted to get the repairs done while we were still close to a blacksmith&#39;s shop and a place where we could buy supplies.

Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] also said we&#39;d be going over a number of creeks and rivers soon. He wanted all of us to prepare our wagons. 

We need to try to waterproof all of our containers as much as possible. This will make it a little more difficult to get to the goods, but it should also help to keep them safe for much longer. 

We&#39;re also supposed to put tar along the inside edges and between the boards. The thinking is that will help keep out more water. Of course, this also makes anything that touches the tar because sticky. 

It seems like everything out here will be a compromise in one way or another. Nothing is easy.

Captain said that over the next few days we&#39;ll be crossing the Doyle, Riley, Deep, Lost, Vermillion, Boxelder, Brush, Rock Vreeks. He said the Vermillion and Rock Creeks are the ones where we really have to be careful. I guess every year, some people don&#39;t make it over those creeks and are buried nearby.

This evening, we were sitting around the campfire and a few of the others got to talking about politics. 

I generally stayed away from such topics and was just silently listening when someone asked a question for us to answer.

When it came time for me to respond, I tried to say I wasn&#39;t listening, but they repeated everything and asked again.

So I felt like I had to say something.

The questions was, &quot;In the presidential election in &#39;48, who had a larger percentage of the popular vote?&quot;

(display: &quot;cloudlevel4&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel4&quot;) (display: &quot;rainlevel3&quot;)

We made it over all the creeks. Vermillion and Rock Creeks were rough. They both have steep banks and the Vermillion had a very swift current.

Today was terrible.

It is with a heavy heart that I have to report two people drown today.

The first was a young girl. She was only four years old. She was riding in the back of her wagon when it tipped in the swift current of Vermillion Creek. She lost her hold and fell into the water. Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] had assigned riders and men to be stationed along the river to lasso and rescue anyone that fell into the water.

They were able to get her out quickly, but she had stopped breathing by the time she was pulled to the shore. I was there. I tried to help. I feel terrible.

The second was a young husband. He was in his early twenties. His name was Jim Anderson. We had spoke several times, but I didn&#39;t know him or his family well.

I heard he wasn&#39;t able to swim. So Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] had put him on one the horses to cross the Vermillion. I&#39;m not sure exactly what happened as I wasn&#39;t there, but I guess the saddle was not tight enough and it rotated a bit on the horse. When that happened. Jim slipped off. He went under and never resurfaced.

We spent time burying Abigail on the western bank. We searched for a long time to find Mr. Anderson, but never found his body. We placed a gravemarker for him next to Abby.{(set: $morale to it - 5)}

Rock Creek is one I will never forget. It wasn&#39;t as deep, and it wasn&#39;t as fast as Vermillion, but the bank on the far side was much steeper and higher.{
(if: ($numberofchildren1 is 3))[&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our youngest child, (print: $childname3) had already made it safely across, but moved back to the edge of the creek to help get any items that had fallen out of the wagons.

I heard shouting and screaming. I turned in time to see a ox stumble on the muddly bank and bump (print: $childname3) into the water. It happened in an instant.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I ran down to the water and dived in. I thank God the current was not swift. I was able to swim out and get (if: $childgender3 is 2)[her](if: $childgender3 is 1)[him] quickly. We made it back to shore with a number of lassos around us.

}
It wasn&#39;t until right before I wrote this journal entry that I realized we also lost 20 pounds of food out the back of the wagon. It must have happened as we were climbing the bank. That is nothing compared to almost losing my child, but I wanted to record it.{(set: $food to it - 20)}

We camped just north of Rock Creek. I don&#39;t know if I would have had the strength to go much further.

Dear Diary,

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel4&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel3&quot;) (display: &quot;rainlevel3&quot;)

Last night, I barely slept. I kept thinking about what happened yesterday and worrying about crossing the Black Vermillion today.

We drove for most of the day with very few problems but the terrain was much hillier than anything we&#39;ve been through so far. It was hard going.

We stopped at noon to water the animals and get a bite to eat. While we were stopped, some people at the front of the train said they saw some Indians in the distance. 

By the time I made my way up there to see them, they had gone. I kept watch for the remainder of the day, but never saw anything.

When we made it to the Black Vermillion in the late afternoon (after even more hillocks), it took us a while to figure out where and how to cross it. 

While we were scouting the area, we came across and man named Mr. Louis Tremble. He is half-Indian and half-French. He and his family live in a rough log cabin near the bank. He has seven children.

They were working to build a rudimentary log bridge over the river. He aims to charge people a dollar a wagon to cross. I&#39;d be happy to pay the toll if the bridge was finished, but seeing how it is only partly constructed we had to ford the river.

The banks were as steep as Rock Creek and the water was even faster than Vermillion Creek we crossed yesterday.

I think because of what happened yesterday, everyone was especially careful. One horse and a couple of cows drown, but everyone made it safely across. 

While we were waiting on the eastern bank to cross, I noticed a bunch of stone grave markers. I took a minute to walk over and investigate. Each one was engraved with a name and a date.

Mr. Tremble said about fifty people from a large wagon company died here in 1849 of cholera. 

After crossing, we moved north another seven miles or so before we made camp. It was a physically exhausting day, but emotionally it was much easier.

Dear Diary,

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel3&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel4&quot;) (display: &quot;rainlevel1&quot;)

We made it to the junction of the trails from Independence and from St. Joseph. Since we started out, I&#39;d guess we&#39;ve seen (either:&quot;five or six&quot;,&quot;six or seven&quot;,&quot;seven or eight&quot;,&quot;eight or nine&quot;,&quot;about ten or so&quot;) other wagon companies. Sometimes they were nearer to us and other times they were a few miles away. 

Rarely though, did we camp next to each other. 

Tonight&#39;s campsite is within throwing distance of nearly half-a-dozen other wagon trains. A whole bunch of them came out from St. Joseph. 

We talked for a little while with some people from the other trains. It was good getting to hear different stories.

I have learned that I can leave Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] and switch wagon companies if I want to. This is a big choice.

After talking with many others, I&#39;ve learned that Captain Taylor seems to be very strick. His wagon company often feels like they are not treated with a lot of respect. However, he certainly seems to have the most experience of all the captains. Hid wagon company is much larger than the others. Captain Hutchins has a reputation for patience and kindness. Although, he seems to let the people in the company decide what to do and this might be bad as he is the one who is supposed to be most experienced. Captain Powell likes to watch and appears to be reluctant to make decisions, unless it has something to do with animals, then he is very knowledgeable. He is the captain with the least experience. His wagon train also has the fewest number of wagons.]

We drove long and hard all day. We barely stopped to water the animals at noon. Some of the wagons have started reporting they are running a little low on water. We&#39;ve been running parallel to the Little Blue River but are usually more than a mile or two away. I think we may have to send a couple of teams with barrels to refill soon. I&#39;ll ask Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] what he thinks.

I&#39;m pretty sure a few people in the train are sick. Their wagons are a lot quieter today. 

People are also a bit short tempered lately. Men are arguing and the women are openly criticizing each other.

Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] says that the trail splits into different sections tomorrow. He says that we&#39;ll have to vote on which way to go.

Dear Diary,

We made Timothy, that&#39;s the boy&#39;s name who was shot, as comfortable as possible. 

We decided not to spend the night in the same campground, so after we got the wounded as comfortable as possible in the wagons, we moved on.

For hours, and for every bump we went over, you&#39;d hear the boy cry out. It was one of the worst experiences in my life.

We camped well before sunset to make sure we could choose the best defensible space possible. 

I don&#39;t know if anyone actually got any sleep.

In the morning, we rolled on. Timothy did not seem to be in as much pain today as he barely made a noise.

The man with the broken arm walked most of the day. He said it hurt but that he was alright.

Tomorrow, we are supposed to make it to where the Omaha and Nebraska City Trails merge with ours. It is also the point at which we will be traveling next to the Platte River.

I&#39;m exhausted but have to stand watch for a couple of hours tonight.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel2&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel3&quot;)

We made it to the junction with the Omaha Trail.

I&#39;ve never seen so many wagon trains. The white canvas bonnets stretch off to the eastern horizon. It was quite a sight to see. They almost look like ships on a sea of endless grass. There must have been almost five hundred wagons in my view.

It was a sight I think I&#39;ll remember until the day I die.

As we were making our way westward today, I spent quite a lot of time talking with {(if: $captain is 1)[Anne Dunns. She&#39;s quite smart for a nine-year-old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one point, we were talking about books, and I asked her if she liked to read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t like to read,&quot; she said. &quot;I love to read!&quot; She ran over to her wagon, her blonde braids flying from her bonnet, and a returned a moment later clutching a copy of &#39;The Little Mermaid&#39; by Hans Christian Andersen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I had to beg my parents for them to let me bring some books along with us. I told them it was good for my learning and we would want books when we make it to Oregon City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This book is one of my favorites right now.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;I really like that one as well. Do you like any others?&quot; I shouldn&#39;t have asked because she spent the next two hours or so telling me all about her favorite books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anne apparently loves anything by Charles Dickens but &#39;A Christmas Carol&#39; is her favorite. She also loves &#39;Jane Eyre,&#39; &#39;The Count of Monte Cristo,&#39; and the new one by Emily Bronte, &#39;Wuthering Heights.&#39; It seems her favorite of all time is &#39;The Leatherstocking Tales&#39; by James Fenimore Cooper. She just loves &quot;all the action and how brave Hawkeye is.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anne was also very particular about telling me how she doesn&#39;t just read literature. She also really likes &#39;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass&#39; by Frederick Douglass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We spoke for a while about slavery and about how some people saw it as a great evil while others saw it as an economic necessity. She said, &quot;I could never do that to someone else. I think it is horrible to keep loved ones apart. I couldn&#39;t imagine being taken from my family or for my family to not have me around.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she spoke, her eyes sparkled and her smile never stopped shining. She is quite a remarkable child.]

Maybe, if I work really hard, maybe someday when I&#39;m older, I can even be an Apostle. I mean, if God wants me to serve in that way.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We spoke for well over two hours.

I think that is because that is what is mostly spoken at home, especially with his grandparents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;We lived in a two room house near Sullivan and Prince. It was a nice place and the neighbors were great. I miss my friends.&quot; He paused. &quot;I mean I am looking forward to California a lot, but I sometimes wonder what all my friends are doing?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I told him I also miss a lot people from where I used to live. I asked him what he was excited about in California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Well, the gold of course. I mean, if there&#39;s any left. I heard a lot of people rushed out there to get it all. I hope that after we settle down, I can go off and starting finding my own gold.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He spoke at least for the next hour about all the things he would do with his riches. He would buy nice clothes, a big house, have several horses, and go riding whenever he wanted. All in all, he is quite a nice young man. I hope his finds his gold.]}

Dear Diary,

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel2&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel4&quot;)

We&#39;ve been talking about Fort Kearny for days and days. In my mind, I&#39;d worked it up to this amazing fortification.

However, when we arrived, it, like most forts out here on the prairie, is not actually a fort at all. It is a station for troops and supplies. That&#39;s all. 

It sits atop a hill perhaps a couple of miles south of the Platte River. For all I can see, it consists of five or six unpainted wooden buildings and two dozen long, low sod buildings. The wooden buildings are situated around a large open field or parade ground. The sod buildings seemed to have sprung up from the ground as they are scattered here and there without much rhyme or reason. Bordering the parade ground are a number of stunted trees. The next closest trees or bushes are along the sides of the Platte.

There are a number of military guns or artillery sitting next to the parade grounds. I can&#39;t imagine how much work it took to get those guns out here in the middle of nowhere.

On the west side of the parade ground, sits the home of the commanding officer. It is a two story, unpainted building . It has two long piazzas that stretch along the entire front of the building.

Opposite the parade ground from the commanding officer&#39;s house is the soldier&#39;s barracks. It seems to be about 30 feet wide and 70 feet long. It is also two stories tall. I must confess that although Fort Kearney is only a year or two old, the barracks looks to already be in a state of disrepair. Not only does it look like it might fall down soon, it appears to be significantly over-crowded.

I overheard one of the soldiers saying it was build for eight men but there is not more than a hundred crammed in there.

The remaining wooden buildings include the officers’ quarters, the hospital, and a merchant’s store. Like the barracks, these buildings also look like they were not quite finished and noone has woked on them in a while. 

The wooden structures make the sod buildings look like royal palaces though. The sod buildings are not uniform in size. The biggest one is around 140 feet long and 40 feet wide. I&#39;d guess that it was maybe 10 or 12 feet high. All 24 of them looked like they would collapse at any moment.

All that being said, it was a welcome relief to stop at the fort. It was great getting to speak with other people, to see the soldiers march on the parade grounds, and to hear the military bugles playing their songs.

[[I&#39;m going to stop recording for now and go talk to the others.-&gt;fortkearney2]](set: $daycounter to $daycounter + 1)(set:$daysonthetrail to it + 1)(set: $totalmiles to $totalmiles + 18){

It was a cold and wet night. First thing this morning, Captain made us all take our scurvy medicine. I hate the taste of that stuff, but I know it is needed to keep us all healthy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After I returned from the medicine call, I was getting the wagon ready. I noticed a part of the canvas was loose. When I want to tighten it down, I discovered the the rope had been cut. When I lifted the flap, I realized someone had stolen a box of food. I can&#39;t even begin to explain how angry this made me. I noticed that other wagon train got going real early this morning.

We&#39;ve been attacked!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sometime in the middle of the night, one of our sentries started shouting. I woke up in a start and looked around. Since it was so dark, I couldn&#39;t really see anything. The sentry was shouting that someone was trying to steal some of the horses.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A bunch of us got up and within a moment, we heard gunshots! I saw a few flashes from the darkness beyond our campfires. Within a minute, the gunfire stopped, but then we heard someone crying out.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As we ran around trying to figure out what was going on, I came across a young man lying on the ground. He was holding his stomach and crying. He couldn&#39;t have been more than fifteen years old.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We brough over some light and it was horrible. He had been shot! His shirt was covered in blood. He kept crying. I couldn&#39;t stand the sight of it, so I ran back to our wagon.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I feel so terrible for not being able to help. As I write this, I can still hear him crying and whimpering.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I also learned that another person was also wounded. It seems that when he was running to see what was happening, he tripped on something in the camp and broke his arm.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is terrible.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Captain said we will stay here an extra day to treat the wounded. He is tripling the number of sentries tonight and we will keep the extra guards until we&#39;re far away from this area.

Dear Diary,

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel2&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel3&quot;)

The day was uneventful. We left Fort Kearney with the sun still below the horizon. We saw some Indians off to the distant south. They were perhaps a half-a-mile away. I wouldn&#39;t have even seen them if someone hadn&#39;t pointed them out and let me use their binoculars.

I&#39;m tired from our early start. I&#39;m heading off to bed.

2nd Entry -

Overnight, the weather turned. It came in almost without warning. When we went to sleep, the winds were calm and the skies were clear. Sometime in the middle of the night, a terrible wind came in from the west. Within thirty minutes, the stars were covered by clouds.

Not five minutes later, we saw lightning on the horizon. Within another twenty minutes or so, it was on top of us. 

Then, one of my worst fear happened. The thunder startled the cattle and they began to stampede. The river goes basically east and west here. There was not bend in the river nor a cliff or canyon we could place them in once we made camp. So, we placed them between the wagons and the river. It wasn&#39;t enough.

In the flashes of lightning, I saw riders and others trying to take action. The riders attempted to turn the heard back to the river in the hopes of slowing them down or stopping them. But, time and time again, the herd would race to the water and then turn left or right.

One time, they turned toward our circled wagons. I thought the familiar sight would calm them, but they raced right though. 

Several wagons were tipped completely on their side. A number of people were hurt. A dozen or so animals were killed or injured to the point where we had to put them down. 

We tried to pick up the wagons and tend the wounded all while this deamon storm raged around us. 

I pray for mercy.

3rd Entry - 

It has been two days since I last wrote. 

The storm blew and blew. It was unbelievable. I&#39;ve never seen a storm like it in my life. We couldn&#39;t continue on as the prairie turned into a  swamp. Everything was muddy. Little streams appeared from nowhere, all running northward to the Platte.

Those injured in the stampede are more or less ready to travel. One elderly grandmother injured her back pretty badly. As soon as they&#39;re able, that family will head back to Fort Kearney to visit the hospital.

Speaking of which, about two dozen soldiers on horseback stopped by this afternoon to speak with Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]. They spoke for maybe 15 minutes before heading on to check on other wagon companies in the area.

I am completely exhausted.

Dear Diary,

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

{[(if: (history:) contains &quot;healingup1&quot;)[I hate to write this, but Timothy, the poor boy who was shot a few days ago, has died.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We thought that maybe staying in Fort Kearney for a few days would help, we knew there was a hospital here. But nothing could save the boy. He had a fever, and it just got worse and worse. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I stopped in with his family only once. I tried to say some comforting words, but I was sort of tounge-tied. Even though I saw him by the light of a lantern, he was ashen-colored. His eyes were closed, and he was covered with sweat. He was sort of mumbling to himself. His father paced near the wagon as his mother and younger sister sat next to him in the wagon. They looked almost as pale as Timothy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We buried him a little after noon.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I feel terrible for the family. I wish there was more I could do.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The boy&#39;s family have decided to turn around and head back east with the rising sun tomorrow. I guess they&#39;re just too heartbroken to continue on.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Such a loss.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Aside from this terrible incident,{(set: $morale to it - (5 +(random: 0,5)))}]]} I was able to speak with a number of people today. At one pointed, I walked over to the merchant&#39;s tent. I&#39;ve learned that this isn&#39;t just any old merchant, but a special type called a &#39;sutler&#39; or &#39;victualer.&#39; A sutler is a civilian merchant who sells things to an army - like uniforms, equipment, and specialty food items like sugar and coffee.

Regardless, he was happy to see me and showed me what he had for sale.

A child who had been injured in the stampede from a few nights ago has gotten worse. 

When the cattle crashed through the camp, she was lying under one of the wagons. When it tipped over, part of the wagon landed on her legs. Both were broken, but we thought they had been set and were beginning to heal. 

Today, she was clearly in pain, but she began to complaing of a vague pain in her chest and having a hard time breathing. We didn&#39;t understand how as her legs were hurt but nothing touched her torso.

In the afternoon, she developed a high fever and a rapid pulse. She also had a rash on her back. She also complained of having a terrible headache and was very drowsy.

Some of us volunteered to keep watch with her family tonight. I am one of them. I pray for the best.

2nd Entry - 3:30 am. Forgive me if this is hard to read. My hand shakes uncontrollably. An hour ago, her fever spiked. She became delirious. Then she went into convulsions. She slipped into a coma and within a few minutes, she was gone. Stephanie was nine years old. She was only nine.

We passed a company of twenty-five wagons. It was all men. They were going to the mines of California. To be honest, I&#39;ll be a bit surprised if they make it. They are big enough and strong enough, but even in the few minutes that we were passing them, they were shouting and arguing with each other. I wish them well.

When we made camp, some of the men who served on the first watch got into a bit of a scuffle. There was some argument over a woman.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} intervened quickly. The men were put on different watches, but I doubt their fight is over.

Dear Diary,

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} called a meeting once we set up camp. He said, &quot;Alright, we have to make a choice tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can stay on the south side of the Platte River and keep moving west. This will add two or three days to our trip. The benefite is that we will likely avoid the traffic of the other wagon companies. The water is generally a bit better on the South Platte as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, we can cross over the Platte. It is not an easy passage, but it is considerably shorter.&quot;

We talked about it for a while before we moved off to our tents.

I think I mentioned this already in this diary (if not, I know I&#39;ve spoken with some of the others about it), but there are two men who seem to get into arguments every few days as they both desire to court a young lady. 

The lady is question is Ms. Samantha Green. I&#39;d guess she is nineteen or twenty, pretty, and with a good upbringing. She is accompanying her mother and father, who is some sort of businessman, out to Sacramento.

One of the whose has taken a fancy to her is Mr. Andrew Clarkson. He is a young firebrand. He can&#39;t be more than twenty-one. He&#39;s been a ranch hand on some place outside of Cincinatti. He has a reputation for having a quick temper and being fiercely loyal. 

The other man, Mr. Stephan Jacobs, is much older, possibly even in his mid-forties. He worked in some sort of printing press. He is slow to anger, but once he is mad, he stays that way for days.

Anyway, I have a decision to make and it is not about the little love spat going on.

Tragic news! The Dunns’ eldest daughter, Anne, drown today.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The river here is actually broken into different sections. You&#39;d make it over one stretch over water that is, say, eighty feet across, then go over some dry land for a hundred feet, going between trees and bushes, then pass through another fifty feet of water. Once through that, you might go over solid ground again for a small bit and then through another section of water, perhaps, one hundred feet across.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As were crossing in this manner, the company got quite spread out. Wagons were crossing upstream and downstream from us. Some wagons from other companies even mingled in with our train. It was not as organized as when we crossed the Kansas River all those days ago.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the confusion, Anne was walking along behind the wagon. She somehow slipped under the surface. We think maybe her dress just got too heavy with water and pulled her under. She never cried out for help or made any sign she was in trouble. It happened so fast.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We made camp on the north side of the river. We will bury Anne in the morning. The dear child was only nine years old. We will mourn her.(set: $morale to it -5)(set: $annedunnsisdead to 1)

In the confusion, young Christian slipped under the water. Johannes said he was carrying a heavy box of flour over his head so it wouldn&#39;t get wet. It must have somehow got tangled in his clothing for he didn&#39;t resurface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By the time anyone realized what was happening, it was too late. Johannes, Kristine, and I all tried to revive him, but we were unsuccessful.

In the confusion, Wilhelm was walking along beside the wagon, helping to keep the rear wheels moving. At some point, he went underwater. We don&#39;t know why or how. All we know is that after a few minutes, Hans and Emma noticed he wasn&#39;t back there. Paul, their eldest son, immediately ran back into the middle of the river. He kept calling and calling for Wilhelm. After searching for a little more than half and hour, another family spotted his body on some rocks on the bank.

We saw a large number of Indians today. They would ride up to within about a quarter-of-a-mile of the wagon train and then turn and ride back to the north. They would be gone for twenty minutes or so and then they&#39;d come roaring back down on us. Every time, they would turn and ride away. 

We were all confused and, to be honest, a bit scared. They didn&#39;t appear to be dressed for war and they weren&#39;t shouting or making war cries, but it was still unnerving. 

As a precaution, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} doubled the watch tonight. As a result, I have three hours tonight of trying to stay awake, not get eaten alive by mosquitoes, a somehow see as good as a cat in the dark night.

We camped about two miles north of the river. To get here, we had to climb up maybe two-hundred feet above the river.

We kept a fair distance from the river today. I think the closest we came to it was probably about a mile.

It seems that some of the scouts who went out a couple of days ago heard there were two wagon companies that were down by the river who have an epidemic of cholera.

There is a rumor going around that nearly half of each wagon company has died in the last two days.

Now I understand why we made camp so far away.

I hope the rumors are wrong and that only a few people have died (if any).

I saw my first buffalo herd today. It was quite a sight!

The herd was maybe a mile or two to our north. They were moving westward along the base of a series of hills protruding from the ground. About half-way up the hill and again at the top, a thick bank of lighter soil ran horizontally.

It was actually looking at this striping when I first saw the buffalo. They were dark against the light tan of the hill. At first, I thought they were some type of dark brown vegetation as it covered so much area. After a few minutes, I noticed they were slowly moving. 

I borrowed a spyglass, and, sure enough, they were buffalo! There must have been thousands and thousands of them. 

I wonder if we will see them again on the trail. 

To the west, we can see the spire of Chimney Rock or Chimney Tower. It is said to be over three hundred feet tall.

Dear Diary,

Well, I&#39;ve found out that the buffalo, or bison as a few people have called them, are everywhere!

The seem to go from horizon to horizon. There are a number of hills and mounds to the north and the buffalo seem to be over nearly all of them.

The wind shifted from the north and brought with it quite a distinct odor. I&#39;ve never smelled anything quite like it. It wasn&#39;t a bad odor, per se, but it was very... buffalo.

We passed by Chimney Rock or Chimney Tower today. It was on the south side of the river, so we couldn&#39;t get too close. It was nice seeing it after hearing about it for months.

We made it to Fort Laramie today in the early afternoon. 

Like Fort Kearney, this fort has no fortification or stockade. It sits near a bend in the Laramie River in the flat bottom of a wide valley with low hills on all sides.

The fort was build around a central parade grounds that was somewhere in the range of four-hundred feet square. There were a dozen or so buildings including the commanding officer&#39;s house, officers and enlisted barracks, a hospital, and a sutler&#39;s store.

The soldiers I spoke with were polite and seemed, more-or-less, happy to be out here.

After we made camp, I made my way over to the sutler&#39;s store.

A mother two wagons down from ours we taken about three o&#39;clock last night with violent diarrhea and severe cramps. She returned to her tent apologizing for waking everyone. 

When we woke this morning, she didn&#39;t. Everything was done to save her, but she was already weakened from days of high fever. We buried her in a proper grave at four o&#39;clock this afternoon.

My diarrhea is worse today - it is closer to rice water than anything else. I have also developed a fever and flip back and forth between sweating and shivering. 

I had really wanted to get about and talk with the others, but I find I prefer to stay in the tent. I&#39;m hoping the extra rest and tea will keep me from ending up like that poor mother.

Dear Diary,

Feeling a bit better. I made some tea that helped to settle my stomach. 

I think maybe some of the buffalo meat we ate was bad.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} has called a meeting.

He says that when we leave Fort Laramie, we have three choices. We can go west on the northern route, the central route, and the southern route.

If we go north, we will stay north of the Platte until we reach Casper. That is about 120 miles or so away.

If we go the central or southern route, we will stay south of the Platte River but will get closer to the mountains. We won&#39;t actually go into them, but the terrain is hillier. However, the trail is a bit shorter. We will once again merge with the northern trail once we get to Casper. To go on either of these routes, we have to cross the Platte River in the morning.

The winds on the prairie are unbelievable. (display: &quot;windlevel5&quot;)

We camped next to Lodgepole Creek. It is a meandering little creek with pretty nice water. We refilled the barrels.

The terrain is fairly flat with just a few very low hills. There are very few trees of any notable height here and the few trees there are all right up against the creek.

Mosquitoes are a bit bad here.

Last night, maybe an hour after we all settled down, we heard some hooping and hollering and a bunch of galloping horses. I small band of Indians raced in and cut some of our horses from the rest of the herd. Me and a few others attempted to chase after them, but owing to the darkness, the unfamiliarity with the terrain, and the knowledge that we didn&#39;t want to get too far from our camp, we gave up and turned back. 

It took us more than an hour to find the camp in the dark. If this happens again, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be so foolish as to race out onto the prairie in the middle of the night.

This morning, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} ordered us to break into teams and try to find the animals driven out of camp last night. Turns out, when the Indians startled the herd last night, they actually drove out five horses, two mules, and six cows. 

So, we split into a number of teams and moved off in all directions of the compass. 

After an exhausting and unsuccessful tramp over the prairie for several hours, we made out way back to camp. Once there, we learned that we managed to fine &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the horses. It had been hobbled before we all turned in and, as a result, was not able to keep up with the rest of the animals.

We were saddened at the loss of the animals.(set: $morale to it - (1 + (random: 0,2)))

To the west, we can see the spire of Chimney Rock or Chimney Tower. It is said to be over three hundred feet tall.

We passed right by Chimney Rock today. It is very impressive when standing near its base. That is one big rock! The spire reaches so high up. We saw a couple of eagles circling near the tip and they were tiny. 

We camped near an area with quite a lot of low bushes. The terrain is made of a number of hills that have significant erosion. Off to the south is a pale, tan ridge. It sort of sticks out with all the light greens and browns of the prairie.

Early today, a boy was biten by a rattlesnake. His hand has swollen and he is in a lot of pain. They are going to bleed him to make him better.

Sad news. That boy that got bit didn&#39;t make it. Sometime in the middle of the night, he passed. His arm got worse and even turned a bit black. He had a hard time breathing. Everyone had some suggestions on what to do to help, and I think it might have been the combination of all of these that actually did the poor boy in. We buried him a little after sunrise.{(set: $morale to it - 1)}

Aside from that tragedy, we had a hard time going up and down a series of fairly steep hills today. You&#39;d get the team up one, crest the top, and start down the other side within a handful of minutes. Going down hill is actually a bit harder as the wagon doesn&#39;t want to stop.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} told us we need to use some rope to tie off the rear wheels. If we don&#39;t let them spin, then they act as something like a brake or an anchor. It helps a bit. 

I&#39;ve got to learn some better knots, though. I had to ruin the rope by cutting it as I couldn&#39;t get the knot free.

Live and learn, I guess.

We passed by Scotts Bluff today. It stands nearly a thousand feet high. We&#39;ve seen it for days, but we passed it today. It was a welcome sign. It means we&#39;re really making progress.

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

We made it to camp after another long and difficult day. We just spent the last two hours fording the Platte.

The wagon company was fairly organized but we still split into three main areas where we crossed. The first group, to which we were a part, crossed at the narrowest point. The river here was maybe one hundred-sixty feet across. It was maybe a bit deeper here and the flow was maybe a bit faster, but we wanted to spend as little time in the water as we could. 

The second group crossed and area that was probably twice as wide but included a sandbar in the middle of the river. This group had a difficult time with quicksand on both sides of the sandbar. It took them the longest time to finally make it across. We had actually set up camp by the time everyone from that group made it in.

The third group thought it would be best to cut across the river diagonally. As a result, they were in the river for nearly a quarter of a mile. Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} was with this group and spent a lot of time trying to get everyone across. Unfortunately, one man drown. I think he was just worn out from walking all day and then spending so much time in the cold water. He was clearly struggling but refused help. Then, he doubled over like he had camps. His feet came off the bottom and he was swept down the river. Before anyone had time to do anything, his head slipped under the surface. They recovered his body nearly a mile down the river. His family and a few others dug him a grave near a feeder creek. 

Tomorrow, we are supposed to make it to Fort Laramie. I know I could use a few days of rest and the wagon is in need of repairs.

The mosquitoes are pretty bad here. I think the multiple bodies of water here make for a nice place for the mosquitoes to live. It would honestly be a pretty area to live if it weren&#39;t for the non-stop buzzing. 

The terrain is covered with hills. To the north, we can see larger hills. 

I saw some pronghorn today.

We only made it fifteen miles today. The terrain was more challenging than I had anticipated. 

There were lots of little ruts the we kept getting sliding into. It wasn&#39;t hard to get out of each one, but when taken all together, it slows us down considerably.

We saw a troop of about mounted infantry today. They were about 40 strong and rode going back in the direction of Fort Laramie. They stopped only briefly to check in with the Captain. 

After the soldiers rode on, we saw a small band of Indians moving the same direction but a short distance off in the foothills to the south.

I saw a few wild turkeys today. This is the first time I&#39;ve seen any out on the trail.

These mosquitoes are the worst! Hunger, cold, heat, even cholera, may be endured or cured, but mosquitoes have no remedy. They must only be suffered through.

The terrain is far more rugged than anywhere since we&#39;ve started on the trail.

There are more and more mountains to our west. We&#39;ve actually been traveling in and near them for days, but the mosquitoes have been such a distraction that I&#39;ve failed to write about the size and beauty of the mountains.

The vegetation includes shorter grasses and scrub brush. There is a lot of sage but very few trees.

We only made it ten miles as it takes so long to get the wagons up and down the hills.

We camped in a nice valley. The pine are not as abundant but there are a lot of cottonwood in this valley. The terrain is a bit more rugged the further we go west.

When we&#39;re up on top of the hills (which are several hundred feet higher than today&#39;s camp), we can see for miles. Further west and south, we can see sizable mountains. They are still days away but the grow with every passing mile.

It is beautiful country.

Mrs. Lilly Bengtson passed away today. 

She had been suffering from severe diarrhea for a while now. She&#39;d been using a lot of laudanum to treat it. She was taking stronger and more frequent doses as that was the only thing that appeared to help ease her suffering.

Early this morning, she complained that she was having a harder time breathing. Her nose and lips were a slight bluish or purplish color. Her pupils were tiny. 

In the hours before she passed, she seemed to flip from feeling great, even saying she could walk all the way to the end of the trail if we would let her, to feeling depressed. Within a few minutes of her death, she started crying saying it was all for nothing. 

Her breath became more and more labored. Eventually, she just stopped breathing.

Her husband, Lucas, and their three children have a much harder path ahead of them.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} ordered everyone in the wagon to donate a pound of food to them.

I wish them well.

On a seperate note, Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Jacobs got into another heated argument over Ms. Green.

Another long day. 

We made it to a nice, broad valley today. There are trees near the water, but hardly anywhere else. 

The land is dry and the grass is not very nutritious. It looks like a massive herd of buffalo came through the area and devoured nearly all of the good grass. The animals will likely start to suffer soon unless we can find reliable grasses.

We used some dried buffalo dung for our campfires again tonight. We&#39;ve done this before, but it is not as effective as dry wood.

I also want to record one interesting feature of the land. It seems like the buffalo, elk, or deer use certain paths over and over. The paths are a bit more than a foot wide and are often several inches deep. The bottom of these paths are as smooth as if someone had carefully laid out a nice road.

We made it another ten miles over increasingly difficult terrain. 

Camp was set in another broad valley with fairly good grass. This valley is perhaps a half-a-mile wide. There isn&#39;t a lot of water in the riverbed, but there was enough to water the animals and refill barrels. There is enough wood for good fires.

The animals are getting lame. We&#39;re hoping that we can rest them for a few days when we reach Casper. We are taking the time to wash their hooves with strong soap, scrape or cut away any damaged parts, and then pour boiling tar on the sore.

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel2&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel3&quot;)

We are close to the Platte River again. 

There are many wagons in this area. Most are on the north side of the river. 

We heard multiple gunshots from across the river. While we couldn&#39;t see what was going from this distance, it seems like there may have been a murder.

I know the trail is a lot of work, but it should not be driving people to hurt each other.

We made it about twelve miles today. Not a great day for distance, but the terrain is not easy.

A few hunters went out this morning. They&#39;ve come back overloaded with buffalo meat. Once we made camp, we started jerking it. I prefer when the meat is salted for preservation, but that takes longer than jerking.

We slice the meat thin. Then place the stips onto a makeshift scaffold with sticks over the top and about three feet above the ground. We lay the meat on the sticks and keep a slow fire burning underneath. This process takes several hours, but we got it started as soon as we set up camp. 

One man shot and killed a camp dog who was trying to steal some of the jerked meat.

I&#39;d also like to take a quiet moment to record a typical evening in camp.

If you were to walk into our camp, you&#39;d see a range of activities. If you came today, you see some men cutting the buffalo into strips, others making and maintaining the scaffolding, and yet even others keeping the fire at the right temperature and level of smoke.

You&#39;d see women washing clothes and children, some might be ironing, while others are making supper.

You might hear a fiddle or two and a few people singing. Some people would be reading the Bible while others with their noses deep into novels. 

With all this going on, you would also likely hear a preacher reading a hymn or engaged in some sort of religious service. When this happens, the singing and fiddling would usually stop.

The preacher, however, usually did not stop others from playing cards, talking about tomorrow&#39;s route, or deciding who was going hunting.

You would see repairs being made on wagons, animals being tended to, and children running here and there.

All in all, it is an active scene of peace.

The plains are absolutely covered with buffalo. The can be seen in nearly any direction and way off into the distance. I didn&#39;t know there were so many buffalo in all the world.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} said that the trail splits into three distinct routes tomorrow but all rejoin the following day (assuming there are no delays). 

We can cross the Platte to get to the north or central routes tomorrow or wait a day and cross them if we take the southern route.

The distance of the northern route is the longest at somewhere near twenty-two miles or so to rejoin the trail. The central route is maybe a couple miles shorter and stays closer to the Platte. The southern route is the shortest at about eighteen miles but covers the hardest terrain.

Dear Diary,

(display: &quot;cloudlevel5&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel5&quot;) (display: &quot;rainlevel5&quot;)

If the terrible weather wasn&#39;t enough, Mr. Paul Klein passed away today. 

He had been suffering from severe diarrhea for a while now. He&#39;d been using a lot of laudanum to treat it. He was taking stronger and more frequent doses as that was the only thing that appeared to help ease his suffering.

Early this morning, he complained that he was having a harder time breathing. His nose and lips were a slight bluish or purplish color. His pupils were tiny. 

In the hours before he passed, he seemed to flip from feeling great, even saying he could walk all the way to the end of the trail if we would let him, to feeling depressed. Within a few minutes of his death, he started crying saying it was all for nothing. 

His breath became more and more labored. Eventually, he just stopped breathing.

His wife, Gertrude, and his four children have a much harder path ahead of them.

{(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} ordered everyone in the wagon to donate a pound of food to them.

I wish them well.

On a seperate note, Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Jacobs got into another heated argument over Ms. Green.

We made it to a muddy creek this afternoon. We camped just on the west side of the water. The grasses are really drying out. I am getting a little worried that it will get hard to find food for the animals.

Ten wagons decided to part ways with the company today. They said they could move faster without out. Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} tried to convince them to stay on. He said it was more dangerous to go off in such a small train, but they had made up their mind.

I didn&#39;t know any of them well, but I am bit surprised as we all seemed to be getting along. 

I wished them well and hope they have a safe voyage. 

Tomorrow, we&#39;re supposed to get to Casper. There are supposed to be supplies there.

The northern route wasn&#39;t actually that bad. 

We had to go north of a small ridge, and there were a few short sections that were pretty steep, but we made it without any real issues.

Thankfully, the trail was pretty level with only a few slight rises.

Dear Diary,

I think I made a poor choice. The terrain was fine at first, but then we got into a section with some steep hills. This slowed us down considerably.

In the late afternoon, we had to cross the the Northe Platte River.

Most of got over without any problems, but an imbalanced wagon tipped over in the water. All eight of their oxen drown by the time we were able to help. They also lost a lot of their food and clothing. 

The family decided to turn back and try to get more supplies in Casper. There wasn&#39;t a tremendous amount there, so I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll be successful. 

It is my guess that they will actually just end up settling in this area. Most of us don&#39;t have the money to get a new team and all those supplies, so I doubt they&#39;ll be able to do that. Maybe after a few years, they might be able to work hard enough and save some money to try again.

We all wished them well.

Dear Diary,

(display: &quot;cloudlevel1&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel4&quot;)

I didn&#39;t see it directly happen, byt two men got to fighting today. Once again, it was over that woman, Ms. Green.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} was called for, but before he could get there, 
one of the men pulled his revolver from his holster and shot the other man in the chest.

By the time Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} arrived, Mr. Clarkson had died from the gunshot.

By now a large crowd had gathered nearby.

&quot;What happened here?&quot; Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} demanded.

Everyone agreed that Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Jacobs had gotten into a shouting match over who had the right to court Ms. Green, but several people disagree about the specifics.

One person said that Mr. Clarkson had pushed Mr. Jacobs when Mr. Jacobs said he was &#39;older, wiser, and richer, and therefore had the right to court Ms. Green.&#39; Mr. Clarkson disagreed. Then Mr. Jacobs punched Mr. Clarkson in the face.

Another person said that it was Mr. Jacbos who first made physical contact. He said they were arguing and that Mr. Jacobs punched Mr. Clarkson in the mouth. The Mr. Clarkson pushed Mr. Jacobs away.

A third person said that both Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Clarkson rushed each other at the same time, fists swinging.

Everyone agreed that Mr. Clarkson pulled out a knife. Some people said that he then said, &quot;Get away from me or I&#39;ll cut you!&quot; while others said, &quot;No, Mr. Clarkson actually said, &#39;Get away from her or I&#39;ll cut you!&#39;&quot;

Either way, everyone also agreed that Mr. Jacobs drew his pistol and shot Mr. Clarkson. 

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} ordered Mr. Jacobs be taken into custody until it was determined what will happen to him. Several men grabbed him and bound his hands.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} said. &quot;We need to get to the bottom of this. As we all know, those two men have been at each other over Ms. Green for the whole trip. 

&quot;We have to determine what to do with Mr. Jacobs. Is he guilty of murder or was he acting in self-defense?&quot;

Sometime in the night after Mr. Clarkson was killed, Ms. Green ran away from the camp.

We&#39;ve been searching for her for the last three days. Her parents have been distraught. 

Late this afternoon, one of the search parties fired three shots in quick succession, the signal if anyone found something. Within a an hour, the whole camp learned that she had been found about a mile-and-a-half north of camp. Her body was pulled from a small stream barely two feet deep.

Her mother has been wailing for at least three hours. {(if: $jacobsisguilty is 1)[Mr. Green has taken a rifle, a horse, and several days worth of food. He left, despite our attempt to stop him, to see if he could track down Mr. Jacobs.]}

}We overtook the Allen and Jacobs Pioneer Train today. They had stopped because a man had fallen out of his wagon, been run over, and killed instantly. 

They were in the process of digging a shallow grave.

I think I forgot to write down the Mr. Green never came back. Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} sent out days of search parties without any luck. He even hired a few of the local Indians to see if they could find him. After some time, they reported that he was gone.

Mrs. Green barely moves. I think she has given up. It would not surprise me to see her in a grave before the trail is done. She seems to have lost her will to live.

I wonder how many people have have died while on the trail?

}Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} has said we have to make another decision. The trail splits tomorrow for a short time.

We can cross the Sweetwater River and go north of it for two days or so. We will then have to recross it to continue on. It is not a particularly fast moving river, but is can be more like a bog as the water has meandered so many times that the whole riverbed is covered with oxbow ponds and lakes.

We could stay on the southern side and not have to cross the water at all. If we do this, though, we have to go through a very rocky and steep area. The scouts says it is similar to Independence Rock but more jumbled up.

Either way, it is likely there will be complications.

The terrain is rocky desert. There are few plants except near the few streams and creeks.

To the north, the land looks like it was painted with a giant orange paintbrush. The soil in certain areas must have a high iron content that has rusted out.

It seemed like we were either going uphill or downhill today. I don&#39;t know if there was a level piece of ground anywhere we went today.

One wagon tipped over in the early afternoon. A bunch of us stopped to help unload it, set it upright and reload it. This took about an hour.

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

We&#39;ve arrived at the first major junction of the trails. The trail spits here. We can go west-north-west at a general bearing of 290 degrees or sort of continue on rought west-south-west at 250 degress. 

The first way will take us on the most direct route to Oregon, Oregon City, and the Willamette Valley. After roughly three-hundred miles, we can decide to continue on to Oregon or head southwest to Sacramento. From this point, the Willamette Valley is another six-hundred miles or so. Sacramento is about the same distance from that junction to the southwest through some of the harshes desert in North America.

The second main route will take us on to The City of the Great Salt Lake in about two-hundred fifty miles. If we desire, we can then take several routes from the City either westward or northward to take us toward California or Oregon, respectively.

If we continue on toward The City of the Great Salt Lake, we will pass by a few more junctions where we can turn toward Oregon or California.

We passed over a few small streams and a number of dry creekbeds.

The land is increasingly dry. 

The grasses are barely able to sustain the animals. Fortunately, we&#39;ve been able to camp fairly close to water, scarce as it is.

There is an odd beauty to this land. It is quiet in a special kind of way. There are not as many animals here, especially birds. At least I don&#39;t see as many as I did when were were closer to the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers.

Once again, we can choose two possible paths. 

We can go west toward Oregon and California or continue in a southerly direction toward the Great Salt Lake. Just like before, we can get to California by going through Mormon territory, but that means more time in the deep desert (even though it might be the shorter route).

This is area is known as &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; as friends made on the trail often split apart. I know that several of the families I&#39;ve gotten to know well will be going the other way today. 

We chatted about how we would try to keep in touch, but I think we all know we will never hear from each other again. There were hugs and tears, but this is what we all must do.

Long day.

We crossed over several rivers and a number of small streams.

Despite the water we encountered today, the land is drier now. 

Grasses are browner. The sun seems hotter. 

The wind is something I still haven&#39;t really gotten used to. It has been so windy for longer than I can remember, but it seems to have a different feel out here. 

The gusts are stronger. The wind seems to change direction every fifteen minutes. You&#39;d get your hat or bonnet set to block the wind from one direction and then it would come from the opposite side, blowing it back or off your head.

While this is a very minor irritation, it happens all day long.

At least a strong wind helps to keep the insects at bay.

We&#39;re running basically parallel to a dry, sandy creek. It hints at having water, but there is hardly any. The soil is damp in places, and if we dig down a few feet, we can find enough water for the animals. 

About an hour before we reached camp, we passed by a large mesa that rose probably some two-hundred feet about our path.

We camped in a fairly green area with a bit more reliable water. We were able to water the animals really well. We also were able to replenish out water barrels. 

It is not a good feeling seeing the barrels start to empty without a reliable source of water nearby.

There are a lot more arroyos, dry river beds, here. We passed another wagon company today. There were fifty-six wagons in that company.

We&#39;ve arrived at another split in the trail. 

Again, we can go west toward Oregon and California, or we can continue southwest toward the Great Salt Lake.

The scouts have reported that the trail actually splits into many side trails sometimes only a few hundred feet apart. It seems like those that camp before us weren&#39;t quite sure which way they wanted to go.

It honestly all looks the same out here.

We have seen a lot of gulls lately, there must be some water nearby.

Out of nowhere, we come across a large river. It is apparently called the Green River. It is easily one-hundred feet wide and, in some places, could easily be two-hundred. 

To say I am shocked to find such a wide river way out here in these desolate wastes is an understatement. 

Unfortunately, there are no bridges and no ferries. The scouts have riden both up and down stream to find a good fording place. They have came back with their report. 

We can go westward along the river until it narrows to an easier ford. This will add about twenty-five miles and probably two days (assuming we don&#39;t run into any problems). If we take this path, we may not have to float the wagons, but we won&#39;t know for sure until we get out there.

The second option is to ford where we are. This is, unfortunately, at the convergence of two rivers, the Green which is large and a big, sandy river that is maybe fifty feet wide. The area is filled with soft sand. If we take this option, we will need to prepare and then float the wagons 
across.

Dear Diary,

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

It was hard to breathe today as the wind was so strong. It blasts sand, pebbles, and even small rocks into the wagons with such force that it almost sounds like heavy rain.

I have sand and dust in parts I didn&#39;t even know I had.

Every few hours, we have to make sure to clean that animals&#39; eyes and ears.

The thing is I don&#39;t know how this wind keeps up day after day. Where is it coming from?

Today, I saw a woman chasing after her diary. She was writing in the back of her wagon when a gust hit it just right. The light journal went flying.

As we were almost done watering and feeding the animals near noon, I heard a gun go off in camp. 

We rushed over to see a husband, Mr. Robert Stanley, frantically trying to save his wife, Harriet. 

She had been shot through her chest. Mr. Stanley says he was trying to climb back into the wagon. He had held up the rifle for his wife to grab, so she could sort of haul him up. 

Somehow the rifle went off.{(set: $morale to it - (2 + (random: 0, 3)))} 

We stayed long enough to place Mrs. Stanley in a shallow grave. Above here is a wooden grave marker with her name and today&#39;s date.

Mr. Stanley seems to have lost his will to live.

It has been a while since I wrote about her, but Mrs. Green has also passed away. She was the mother of the young lady who was found in the creek and whose husband went out seeking revenge and never returned. Such a tragic story. 

Since the day that her daughter and Mr. Clarkson died and her husband disappeared, she has steadily declined. She lost a lot of weight, seemed to age twenty years, and stopped socializing despite our best efforts.

Since they had no other relatives and no will, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} divided up the food that was left. We were glad to get some.{(set: $food to it + (30 + (random: 0, 70)))}

Today, we spent a good deal of time rolling through some fairly good soil. There seems to be a number of water sources and the land is fairly green. It is almost like an oasis in the desert.

We camped near Fort Bridger.

This is a small trading post owned by Bridger and Bascus. It is a very ppor excuse for an outpost. It seems to be constructed mostly of roughly hewn poles with mud daubed by someone who was either blind or in a hurry.

There are about two dozen more dwellings or lodges in the Indian fashion. Most of the occupants seem to be female Indians and while male trappers although there are a few male Indians as well. I believe their are Snake or Shoshoni Indians. They may also be Paiute. I am not an expert.

They have a large number of furs and skins - elk, deer, antelope. There is a wide range of leather pants, coats, moccasins, and other &#39;mountain man&#39; attire.

They don&#39;t have a lot of supplies that will help us. There is a very limited amount of food, mostly jerked meat. There are a number of cows nearby in a corral.

We were able to catch some trout in the nearby stream.{(set: $food to it + (10 + (random: 0,20)))(set: $morale to it + 2)}

We camped near the summit of a mountain ridge. Normally, we&#39;d stay down in the valleys, but the scouts reports there was a number of large, flat, and open areas where we would have room to set up. 

The timber up here is abundant, so we felled a number of trees we will use now and later for firewood and repairs.

We struggled to drive through some difficult mountains. 

One mountain, in particular, looks like a giant oyster shell. I even went for a short walk up part of it just to see if it was actually made of rock and not shell (it is rock).

We camped in a broad, green valley. I have seen a number of these valleys now, but I am still surprised to find so much green among all the tans and loamy soils.

We left the green valley within an hour of leaving camp. 

From then until the afternoon, we made out way over low hills and through green or nearly green pastures in the bottoms of the valleys. 

We went slow to allow time for the animals to graze.

I overheard Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} talking with some of the scouts. he said, &quot;If things keep moving nicely, we should be down in Salt Lake Valley within a week or ten days.&quot;

When I heard that, I was exceptionally happy. 

This journey has both seemed to take forever and like we&#39;ve not been doing this for long. It is hard to explain. The days blend together to the point that time doesn&#39;t really matter beyond sunrise, noon, and sunset. 

It is actually a pretty good way to live.

We have made it to the head of a long canyon. It looks to be fairly straight and narrow.

The scouts report that there is not much space between the a small river and the bases of the mountains which shoot up on either side.

Tomorrow, we will drive through the canyon, which some children are calling Echo Canyon as their shouts come back strong and clear.

I&#39;m a little nervous about going through this canyon. These mountain are a bit unlike any we&#39;ve seen.

Of course, we have seen mountains and mountain ranges, but from what I can see, these peaks just seem to go on and on. I hope there are good, level places for the wagons. 

I really hate having to climb and descend hills and I can only imagine how difficult it would be to do that over these mountains.

Of note, I saw a herd of deer that had to be close to a hundred animals.

That was a difficult day. The terrain wasn&#39;t too terrible (although there were a few sections that were particularly challenging). The difficult arose in that for many sections, we had to go single file. 

Typically, we could spread out to at least a few wagons wide on the trail, but here, the water and the land forced you through very small gaps. In some places, the wheels of the wagon were pressed on one side by the rocks and were in the water on the other.

Tempers seems to flare a bit today. There were a number of heated arguments. At one point, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} had to ride up to settle a dispute. I am not sure of the details, but it seems that two wagons both thought they had the right to go first. 

I don&#39;t know why people are still arguing over things like that. It doesn&#39;t really matter. We&#39;ll all get to camp within a couple hours of each other.

So, this camp tonight is pretty nice. All day, we were on a course of about two-hundred thiry degrees. In the last thirty minutes or so, we made a sharp right turn to about three-hundred twenty degrees. It is rare to see a ninety degree (or right angle) on the tril.

Another day of climbing. It wasn&#39;t as bad as yesterday, but will still went up somewhere around five-hundred feet or so.

Dear Diary,

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel3&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel4&quot;)

Today was one of the most physically demanding days I have ever experienced. 

We went up at least two thousand feet today. The animals struggled. 

We had a number of minor accidents as wagons either tipped sideways or, and especially, when we were coming down some of the steeper sections. 

Once again, we tied of the rear wheels and in one very steep spot, we even used a rope and pulley system to help keep things as safe as possible. 

Fortunately, no one got hurt.

One massive surprise occurred this evening as we were in camp.

A group of riders approached from the west. They were Mormons who had come up to welcome any other Mormons who had been on the trail. They brought with them some fresh baked pies. They told us that we would mostly likely arrive in the valley by the early afternoon tomorrow.

We were so excited. People spontaneously began to sing, play music, and some even got on their knees to pray.

I can&#39;t believe we are almost to the the City of the Great Salt Lake!

Dear Diary,

I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re finally here. After (print: $daysonthetrail) days on the trail!

It feels surreal.

To be honest, it is a bit overwhelming. I don&#39;t quite know what to do.

There are so many people. I am not used to seeing so many all at once.

Most of us from the wagon company are sort of walking around in a daze.

Dear Diary,

Well, it is official. The wagon company has been disbanded. 

So, now what?

We made our way into town. There were people everywhere.

We eventually found a county office. Upon entering, a tall thin man greeted us.

&quot;Hello there, weary traveler,&quot; he said. &quot;Welcome to Sacramento. My name is Mr. (print: $randomnamedone). How can I help you?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;we&#39;d like to buy some land.&quot; I noticed that compared to Mr. (print: $randomnamedone), my clothing was filty and tattered. We&#39;d have to fix that soon.

&quot;Of course. What type of land would you like? What do you hope to do now that you&#39;re here?&quot;

Longest distance so far. We traveled nearly 40 miles. Everyone and all the animals are completely and utterly exhausted. 

We started early and didn&#39;t run into any problems. Our rest near noon was maybe fifteen miles long. 

While it felt good to cover so much distance as I know it means we are that much closer to getting there, it was also very difficult on everyone and all the animals.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel2&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel4&quot;)

The day started with a difficult river crossing. It was not deep but it was wide. There were many little streams and creeks running in the same valley as the main river. 

One man was bitten by a snake on his leg today. He washed it and kept moving. 

Also, three young boys were stung by a bunch of bees. They were exploring around the river and got to close to the hive. All of them will be fine, but I suspect they will stay closer to their wagon in the future.

Once we left the rive, we climbed up and over a plateau before descending into another broad valley. 

The hardest part of the trail was the finally climb before we made camp. It wasn&#39;t particularly steep (except in a few spots), but it was long - mile after mile of steadingly climbing.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel3&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel4&quot;)

We entered a green valley, crossed out of it for a few miles, and then descended into another valley (they connect a few miles behind us). We stayed in this valley for most of the day. 

I don&#39;t know if it was actually any cooler, but seeing all the green and hearing the water made it feel nicer.

On a sad note, we passed by another wagon company today. They had stopped to bury a young boy. He was sitting next to the driver, his father, when a small bump caused the boy to tumble forward. He fell under the wheels. 

He lived for a short time, but then passed away.

This trail can be so brutal.

Today was a day of switchbacks. The terrain was much more rugged with long ridges where it looks like the land had been lifted up by some great force.

We would make our way parallel to one of these ridges, find a place to go over or around it, then cut back the other direction.

In the afternoon, we entered several narrow valleys or canyons that were bursting with green vegetation. It was so unexpected. After so many days of seeing different shades of brown, this was a welcome relief.

There are also adundant trees. When we camped, many men felled trees and brought them back. We used them for some repairs, for firewood, and to have available should a need arise. 

The mountains surround us now. As I right this, the sun is just below the horizon. The air is cooling quickly. I can hear wolves.

We came out of the mountains today and entered a long and broad valley. It must be at least thirty miles long and perhaps four of five miles wide. 

It is actually one of the most beautiful places I&#39;ve ever been to. Very pretty.

Dear Diary,

(display: &quot;cloudlevel3&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel3&quot;)

I&#39;m am exhausted. 

Today&#39;s trip was most strenuous. We went up and down so many hills as we crossed another mountain range today that I estimate that we went up and down at least a mile in either direction.

Some of the oxen, (print: $ox2) and (print: $ox3) in particular, seemed to be having a hard time. I&#39;ll check them out to see if they are injured somewhere.

Once again, the trees are so abundant here. It is very impressive.

We saw a grizzly bear today. It was opposite a small ravine from us, perhaps a half-mile off to the south. It was walking among the trees and seemed to be flipping over small boulders and searching underneath them.

Even at this distance, it is an impressive animal. I hope we don&#39;t see any more.

Today was an easy seventeen miles or so. 

It was nearly level all day with just a few small hillocks to cross. 

Near noon, we stopped by a wetland area. There must have been thousands of birds either on, under, or above the water. They didn&#39;t seem to mind we were there and would generally ignore us unless we got within a few dozen feet or so. Then, as one, hundreds of birds would take to the wing with such a commotion and noise it was almost unbelievable.

The land is drying out once again.

There are abundant grasses but the trees are fewer and far between copses. 
The trail was pretty level again today. We passed into and out of another broad river valley an hour or so before we camped.

Saw a large pack of wolves today. The seemed to follow us for a mile or so. I think we caught their interest.

We passed a few wagons going east. 

The stopped and we spoke for a few minutes. 

It seems they had been a week or so further along the trail to Sacramento when they all ran out of water. The company splintered. Some continued westward, but the group of ragged men and women we spoke with said they believe they are all likely to be dead at this point. 

They had decided to turn back and find more reliable water.

I can&#39;t imagine having to turn back. 

Before we enter the deep desert, we&#39;ll have to make sure we have as much water as we can carry.

We came across the burned out remains of two wagons. 

It looks like they had been parked next to each other. They must have been careless with a campfire and the wagons caught on fire.

That is one thing that Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]}Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} is very particular about.

Fortunately, I&#39;ve always kept the campfire safely away from everything. Granted, having a closer fire to the wagon would make things easier sometimes, but it is not worth losing everything.

The first half of the day was pretty easy. It was a slight incline moving to the west. Pretty easy for the teams and for all of us.

In the afternoon, the slope more than doubled. Everyone and all the animals were out of breath. I was tempted to keep drinking water, but it looks increasingly scarce out here, so, instead, I have a dry mouth and a chalky tounge.

In the last few hours of the trail, we had to cross through two large arroyos. The banks on either side of both were very steep. 

Once again, we tied of the rear wheels to descend. To pull the wagons up and out, we had to attached additional yokes. It was laborious and time consuming.

I hope we don&#39;t encounter anything else like these but I fear we will.

This was one of the most difficult days yet.

Not only were there endless arroyos - in, down, up, out - over and over, but we had to cross a large river. 

The water was colder than I expected. This made it more difficult as we were in the water for a lot longer than usual. 

Normally, when we ford, you enter the river, make a path almost directly across or slightly down river, and then climb out the other side. 

Today, though, we had to enter the river and then move in it for a considerable distance as the far side was nearly a bog and we would have certainly gotten stuck. So, we kept on moving down the river. We stayed in the shallowest areas possible, but we were still often up to our knees in the frigid water.

It was the last part of the day that was the most exhausting. After being the water for so long, we were all fatigued, but then we had to climb up the finger of a large mountain. 

Usually, when we get to a steep part, it is for a short time. Today, though, it was almost a half-mile of exceptionally steep, rocky slope.

Regrettably, a (print: _victim1) was killed. They were behind their wagon, pushing on the rear wheel to help get up the mountain. Something happened, and the wagon rolled back several feet in the blink of an eye.

The (print: _victim1) was killed instantly when the wheel rolled over them.

We had to bring the (print: _victim1)&#39;s body with us to the top of the mountain before we could bury it.

Yet another grave marker on this trail of sadness.

Dear Diary,

(display: &quot;windlevel3&quot;)

Scouts reported that there was another large mountain we had to cross this afternoon. 

As a company, we voted to go the long way around rather than face another tragedy today. It added five or six miles, but no one died today.

Once again, the hardest part of the day was within a couple of hours of camp. 

We had to still cross the mountain range the scouts warned us about, but we did it in an area that wasn&#39;t as steep. However, this meant that we had to cut back and forth, spending nearly as much time going sideways on the mountain as we did in going up and down.

We camped in an different way than normal. We usually form the wagons into a circle, but the rocky terrain didn&#39;t permit that today. Instead, we formed something resembling a &#39;V&#39; or &#39;U&#39; shape with the ends of the formation up against a low cliff. 

In this way, we were still able to keep the animals safe from wanding (or being driving) away.

All I can say is that I am glad we had that last (print: $totalmiles) miles to help get us in good enough shape to handle this type of challenge. Had this been in the first few days of leaving Independence, I think we would have simply turned back.

So, there&#39;s that.

Dear Diary,

A wagon was coming down South Fork Mountain today and lost control.

It made it round the corner and was just starting to come down the far side. I don&#39;t know exactly what happened, no one does, even though we&#39;ve been trying to figure it all afternoon and evening. Maybe the break failed. Maybe the tongue got loose. Maybe the oxen were to tried to hold back the weight of the wagon.

Whatever the caused, the results are the same.

The wagon, driven by Mr. Daniel Walker, his wife, Rebecca, and their three-year-old daughter, Charlotte, went over the edge. They plummeted nearly eight-hundred feet before finally coming to a rest. 

We heard their screams and saw the dust cloud from where they raced to the bottom of the ravine.

Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] asked for volunteers to climb down and see if anything could be done, but we all knew there was no chance for man or beast. 

We placed three grave markers near where there wagon lost control.

Today, we lost another man.

Mr. Stephen Davis from Frederick County, Virginia. He had gone hunting this afternoon with a few others. 

He was lying in the grass next to a bush. Not seeing any animals, he was in the process of standing up. The shotgun he was carrying must have cocked itself on the bush. It fired, sending buckshot into his upper chest, right shoulder, and right arm. 

I was in camp at the time. I heard the shot and heard the men shouting. I saw Mr. Davis ran a few steps toward the camp and then fell to the ground.

I ran toward him as fast as I could, but by the time I reached him, he had already departed this life. He leaves behind a wife and two children.

In the morning, we have to decide which Cutoff to take. We can go north toward Oregon or south toward the Great Salt Lake. 

If we go north, the trail splits with one path crossing more over the mountains and the other path stay more along a river. The mountains mean we&#39;ll be further from wather, but it is a shorter (if more challening) route.

Dear Diary,

The land is fairly green and once we made camp, it was easy to water and feed the animals.

This region is covered with a series of mountain ranges or ridges that mostly run north to south. In some of the highest elevations and on the north slopes, there still seems to be some snow or glaciers.

It is hard to believe that snow could last in these temperatures.

We can go northwest and then on to the Oregon Territory.

We could also go west-south-west toward Sacramento. Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} says there is one more change to go to Oregon City after this junciton, but going northward now will shave a day or two off the trip.

We made camp in an usual valley. Most of the broad valleys between these mountain ranges are pretty flat with some source of water. This valley, by contrast, is not flat and doesn&#39;t have much water.

Instead, there are numerous large hills. A few months ago, I would have called them mountains as they are several hundred feet high, but after being in &quot;real&quot; mountains for so long now, these don&#39;t seem as grand.

It took us so long time to pass through another range yesterday that we barely made supper before I went to sleep.

Today, we crossed another broad, brown, and flat valley. We have campped on the easter slopes of yet another range.

I&#39;m beginning to think these basins and ranges will never end.

We camped near a City of Rocks. 

There are massive rocks, much taller than any city building. They are mostly granite and gray.

These are sort of tucked up into a larger range of mountains.

Once again, a child was injured when he thought it would be fun to climb up some of the large rocks. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured, just a broken ankle.

I have a feeling he wishes he was more injured as the tanning his father gave him likely felt worse than a broken arm.

A young man, Hans Olson, died today. He was off hunting perhaps a mile or so from the company. 

He and his father, Mr. Lucas Olson, had managed to take a deer. When they went to retrieve it, because it had fallen into a small ravine, Hans had started to climb down into the ravine. His pistol slipped from the hostler, hit a rock and fired.

The bullet went through Hans&#39; heart. He died within moments. There was nothing his father could do except carry his son back to camp.

It took us two days to get here.

Once again, we struggled to travel over the crust. It would break as soon as the wagons rode upon it. 

The wagon would sink an inch or two, the driver would crack the whip, the animals would struggle, and the wagon would roll forward another few inches.

I thought I&#39;d calloused up my hands, but I&#39;ve found that my thumbs are raw from using the whip so much.

No more writing tonight, my hands hurt.

We came across several men sitting or lying by the side of the trail today.

They were sick with fevers and crippled by scurvy. Their legs and arms were bent and swollen and covered with red dots. They begged us as we passed by to give them some assistance, but no one could do it. 

Winter is nearly upon us. Our teams are nearly exhausted. The thought of hauling them in our wagon only meant we would all perish. 

We hated doing it, but since we couldn&#39;t help them, we abondoned them to a slow, lingering death in the wilderness.

May God have mercy on them.

We camped south of a &quot;river.&quot; I use that term loosely as it looks like water flows through the river bed once every ten years. 

We dug down a few feet to try to find enough water for the animals, but there wasn&#39;t enough. It would slowly fill in the hole, but we&#39;d be here for days and days if we waited long enough for it to water all the animals - let alone us.

I know I&#39;ve already mentioned it, but this place is getting to me.

It took us two days to get here.

Once again, we struggled to travel over the crust. It would break as soon as the wagons rode upon it. 

The wagon would sink an inch or two, the driver would crack the whip, the animals would struggle, and the wagon would roll forward another few inches.

I thought I&#39;d calloused up my hands, but I&#39;ve found that my thumbs are raw from using the whip so much.

No more writing tonight, my hands hurt.

We camped on the eastern shore of the Great Salt Lake.

There are so many bugs and birds here, one can&#39;t even count them all.

There is a large island a few miles from where we are. It looks completely desolate.

To our east, a large, rocky mountain rises quickly from the valley floor.

We have made camp in a broad, dry valley. Mountain peaks surround us on all side but south where the Great Salt Lake sits.

The land looks like it has burned recently. I find this odd as there is not a lot of vegetation to start with.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve said this recently, but I hate this wind. It never stops, day or night.

We&#39;ve left the Mormon settlement of The City of the Great Salt Lake behind us.

We spent some time crossing over salt flats today on the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake. The water is not drinkable even though a few people tried it just to see what it is like.

We camped between a mountain range to our south and the Salt Lake to our north. This area is narrow and a number of wagon companies are trying to get the best ground to camp upon. Captain and a few others negotiated with some of the other Captains, but I don&#39;t know what was said.

Tomorrow, we are planning on making our way from today&#39;s camp to the northern point of a second mountain range that also runs north to south. It looks to be about twenty miles west of us.

It took us THREE DAYS to make it across the salt flats. 

A dozen or so wagons turned back. We spoke with them and they are afraid to go on if it is already this difficult.

The main problem is that the salt looks solid, but once you get more than a few hundred pounds on it, it cracks and crumbles away right under the wagons. So, the wheels sink into a slaty brine that is six inches or so under that crust. 

Once that happens, it takes a tremendous amount of effort to get it rolling again. We&#39;re using up a lot of our water just from sweating so much.

Also, of note, along the trail we&#39;ve seen things discarded in the past. I&#39;ve seen stoves and other heavy items on the trail while we were still traveling next to the Platte River.

Here, though, there are necessary items just thrown to the salt. I&#39;ve seen hundreds of pounds of food containers. I counted at least ten spare wheels with nothing wrong with them just sitting there. 

I&#39;ve also seen a number of animals carcasses and skeletons. I&#39;d wager we haven&#39;t gone more than a half-mile without seeing at least one. In some parts, there are many.

The attitude in the company is noticably depressed.{

We lost (print: $ox4) today. {(set: $oxen to it - 1)}I could always count on (print: $ox4) to pull all day long without any complaint. I didn&#39;t think anything was wrong.

I immediately jumped down and ran up. (print: $ox4)&#39;s breathing was labored and rapid. Before I could even return with some water, the breathing stopped.

(set: $weather to $weather+(random: -3,3))(display: &quot;temp1&quot;) (display: &quot;cloudlevel1&quot;) (display: &quot;windlevel4&quot;)

We drove up and over the Cedar Mountains today. 

It was a long climb up nearly 2,000 feet above the valley. Coming down the otherside was hard for two reasons. 

First, the teams are exhausted and it is very difficult to pull wagons downhill. The weight of the wagon wants to make it run out of control. So, we have to literally tie the two rear wheels off so they won&#39;t turn. This mean the rear wheels are constantly dragging. This acts like a continual break. So, it slows down the load, but anytime the trail is level or goes up a slight incline, the team has to pull that much harder.

Second, and in my opinion, this is much worse, is what lies ahead. We all were silently happy that we were leaving the valley floor with its salt flats behind us. However, when we we cresting the mountains, we could see miles and miles of salt flats in the direction we were going. 

To say this is disenheartening would be an understatement.

More desert. More salt. More alkali.

We saw an abandoned wagon today. There were eight oxen corpses still attached in their harness. There was a human body, male, slumped on the ground in front of the wagon and next to the tongue.

We didn&#39;t stay.

We camped west of a long, low ridge of gray sediment. It is perhaps a hundred feet above the surrounding plains. It is a place unlike anywhere we&#39;ve been too so far. 

Tomorrow, I can tell we will have to cross more salt flats. These seem to stretch much further than those by the Great Salt Lake.

Another burning day.

The sand is nearly up to the hub of our wagons. It blows so hard all day long, we are almost blinded by it. When it gets in our eyes, it feels gritty and causes the worst soreness and inflammation.

I&#39;ve never seen dust such as this. A few times today, there was so much dust, that it was actually visible on top of everything. It is more like flour than white dust or sand. Everything is literally covered in it.

The poor animals, I fear, suffer the most. The stagger on thought it like a blinding, burning snow. The are constantly coughing and shaking their heads side to side. 

To be honest, I feel I am running out of patience with it.

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

Another two days have passed. 

We have camped on a the hard, dark brown rock of the Silver Island Mountains. We only just arrived on this hard, easy to travel upon land. For the bulk of the last two days, it has been that dreaded salt crust layer. 

In less than a week, the company has lost over two dozen animals. Teams are now often made up of oxen, mules, horses, and even cows. Every able bodied person pushes from the rear or side of each wagon. 

Children as young as four years old are pushing. It is a sight to see.

We crossed a large, ancient lake today. Once again, it was salt, dust, sand, and alkali. The animals seems to have become blind from the continuous assualt. Many children are refusing to come out of the wagons.

This is a miserable life.

More miles on (and breaking through) the salt flats.

Some of the scouts who have gone westward are saying there aren&#39;t too many more miles left of the salt. Pretty soon, the ground is more reliable.

Water is getting quite low.

We&#39;ve camped on the eastern base of another mountain range running north to south. All these mountains look so much alike it is hard to tell any difference.

If someone were to tell me we had been magically whisked back to were we were over a week ago, I wouldn&#39;t be able to make much of a counterargument.

Far off to the west, I think I can see snow-capped mountains. Hopefully, that will mean fresh water as we are running dangerously low.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} has ordered we equally share all the water we have left. {(if: $waterbarrel is 2)[We didn&#39;t hesitate sharing from our two barrels as we know that the only we we&#39;re going to make it is with the help of everyone in the compnay.]}

One family, {(if: $waterbarrel is 2)[though, ]}the Robinson&#39;s out of Albany, New York, refused. They said they had taken the precautions of carrying a lot of water so they would have enough. It isn&#39;t their fault if other people weren&#39;t as careful. 

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} tried to talk them into sharing, but even after nearly two hours, they simply refused.

As a result, we held a council and voted them out of the wagon train. They can keep their water, but they can no longer stay with us.

They drove off before sunset to make their own camp. 

That, however, still doesn&#39;t help us with out desperate water situation.

We camped at a little dry creek at the point of a low ridge. There are no trees, only sage and scrub. Further west, there are a few mountain ridges. It looks like there might be some greener vegetation over there, so maybe there&#39;s more water. 

Our scouts haven&#39;t found anything yet, but they go out day after day to try to find us something - anything!

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} ordered us to use shovels and dig down in the creekbed. While there isn&#39;t enough water for us, he said we could dig down far enough to get some for our animals. He was right. 

After nearly an hour of digging, we had a little pool of water that would refill itself every fifteen minutes or so. This was enough to water the animals - even though it took rotations well after dark. The water was not good enough for our consumption (and at least we are not desperate enough to try that yet).

Early this afternoon, we came across a man wandering over the desert. 

I believe I have seen insanity produced by thirst. I never wish to see so much suffering again. He was raving mad, burning with fever, and so burned by the sun his eyes were red.

He kept repeating he lost his dog. Over and over.

Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] ordered him help, but nothing could be done. 

We placed some rocks over his corpse and said a few words. 

We will sleep not fifty feet from his grave.

We stopped at the base of the eastern slopes of a large mountain range the runs north to south. 

There is still no water. There is evidence that water runs off the mountains in the spring, but there is nothing now but bone-dry arroyos. 

All the vegetation is brown and brittle.

We ran south today along the eastern slopes of the mountains. They are getting taller as we move south.

Still no water. 

We found a few small pools, but couldn&#39;t let the animals drink as there were a number of skeletons around the pools. We think they are toxic.

This is terrible. I don&#39;t know if I can take this burning thirst much longer.

Today, we made it to the southern end of this mountain range. The terrain is hilly. The vegetation is scrub, sage, and cactus.

Mr. Christopher McAlbers, our lost scout, has not yet returned. The others looking for him have all come back and reported they lost his tracks several miles to the north as then entered the mountains. Those that returned looked like death. Their lips are cracked and bleeding.

People have begun arguing over the lack of water.

Two oxen collapsed today and were left on the side of the trail.

I don&#39;t have the strenght to write more.

We made it to an area with &quot;water.&quot;

There are shallow pools of hot water. They are full of green algea, boatmen and backswimmers, and mosquito larvae. When we first found the water, many used cupped hands to drink it. 

I was one of them.

I found that I could use my closed teeth as a bit of a strainer to keep from swallowing many of the insects and algae.

After our initial thirst was satisfied, we began to boil gallons of water at a time. It took a lot of fuel, but fortunately much of the dry vegetation burns quickly and hot.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} put it up to a vote the day we arrived. We all voted to stay here and replenish out water. So, we&#39;ve stayed here four days boiling and refilling out water. 

The animals do not looks as bad. Their flanks are filling out again.

A lot of the arguments have stopped. I think we were all slowly getting close to losing our sanity.

Mr. McAlbers never returned. It is presumed he is dead.

We drove northward on the western side of the mountains and made over twenty miles. It felt good to have water and to stretch our legs. 

That is when we came upon a beautiful green valley. It is perhaps a quarter of a mile wide and full of green!

Once again, we voted to stay in this place for an extended time.

The animals have been set to graze for a long time. 

The water here is cleaner than a few days ago, so many have emptied their water barrels to refill them. We have not done so as we know that the water has been boiled and even though it is a bit brown, we believe it to be safer.

Molly Walker, aged six, died this morning in camp. 

We were getting ready to head out and I heard a gunshot. 

We all ran to the Walker wagon. Little Molly was lying beside the wagon, a pistol next to her. 

It seems she was handing her father his pistol when it somehow went off. It hit Molly in her head, killing her instantly.{(set: $morale to it - (2 + (random: 0, 3)))}

It has been a while since I wrote about her, but Mrs. Green has also passed away. She was the mother of the young lady who was found in the creek and whose husband went out seeking revenge and never returned. Such a tragic story. 

Since the day that her daughter and Mr. Clarkson died and her husband disappeared, she has steadily declined. She lost a lot of weight, seemed to age twenty years, and stopped socializing despite our best efforts.

Since they had no other relatives and no will, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} divided up the food that was left. We were glad to get some.{(set: $food to it + (30 + (random: 0, 70)))}

We started climbing again. 

After we crossed a broad valley, we mad camp neat the foothills of another massive mountain range.

I know it will be a lot of work to climb up those mountains, but I can see trees and glaciers up there. 

I am ready to move out of this endless desert.

I am greatful we&#39;ve made it this far.

Day (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail.

What a difficult day.

At least a dozen different wagons had problems today. One tipped half-over. Another snapped an axle. A third one broken a rear wheel on a boulder. 

As a result, we only made it five miles or so.

The nights are cool in these mountains.

Three men were severely injured and another killed today.

They had gone hunting when we made camp. We heard a number of shots in rapid succession. Fifteen minutes later, one of the hunters rode into camp, slumped over the saddle.

In the next few minutes, we learned that the men had been tracking some deer through the thick underbrush of the forest. They then stumbled upon a huge grizzly bear not fifteen feet away. By the time they could react, the bear had already knocked two men down. 

Those still standing fired at the grizzly, but the bullets didn&#39;t seem to affect it. The bear whirled on them, knocking one down and mauling the last man standing. 

The two first knocked down were able to recover enough to shoot at the animal. It turned and crashed off through the trees.

The man who returned to camp said he was the least injured, but I can&#39;t imagine how as he looked absolutely frightful.

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} has ordered a large hunting party to be sent out to see if they can kill the bear.

We can see Sacramento in the distance!

We are almost there! Thank heaven!

Some of the townspeople have come out to welcome us and see if we need anything.

It is so refreshing to speak with those that have made it. We are so close we can all taste it.

Dear Diary,

I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re finally here. After (print: $daysonthetrail) days on the trail!

It feels surreal.

To be honest, it is a bit overwhelming. I don&#39;t quite know what to do.

There are so many people. I am not used to seeing so many all at once.

Most of us from the wagon company are sort of walking around in a daze.

Dear Diary,

Well, it is official. The wagon company has been disbanded. 

So, now what?

We made our way into town. There were people everywhere.

We eventually found a county office. Upon entering, a tall thin man greeted us.

&quot;Hello there, weary traveler,&quot; he said. &quot;Welcome to Sacramento. My name is Mr. (print: $randomnamedone). How can I help you?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;we&#39;d like to buy some land.&quot; I noticed that compared to Mr. (print: $randomnamedone), my clothing was filty and tattered. We&#39;d have to fix that soon.

&quot;Of course. What type of land would you like? What do you hope to do now that you&#39;re here?&quot;

We buried tweleve-year-old, Daniel Sherman, today. He was cleaning his father&#39;s pistol when it happened. It seems he didn&#39;t empty the weapon first and when he was starting to clean it, it went off. 

It shot him in the leg. It must have gone through a major artery as he died within a few minutes.

It was horrible.{(set: $morale to it - (2 + (random: 0, 3)))}

It has been a while since I wrote about her, but Mrs. Green has also passed away. She was the mother of the young lady who was found in the creek and whose husband went out seeking revenge and never returned. Such a tragic story. 

Since the day that her daughter and Mr. Clarkson died and her husband disappeared, she has steadily declined. She lost a lot of weight, seemed to age twenty years, and stopped socializing despite our best efforts.

Since they had no other relatives and no will, Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} divided up the food that was left. We were glad to get some.{(set: $food to it + (30 + (random: 0, 70)))}

Dear Diary,

I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re finally here. After (print: $daysonthetrail) days on the trail!

It feels surreal.

To be honest, it is a bit overwhelming. I don&#39;t quite know what to do.

There are so many people. I am not used to seeing so many all at once.

Most of us from the wagon company are sort of walking around in a daze. 

Captain {(if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell]} has called a meeting.

Dear Diary,

Well, it is official. The wagon company has been disbanded. 

So, now what?

We made our way into town. There were people everywhere.

We eventually found a county office. Upon entering, a tall thin man greeted us.

&quot;Hello there, weary traveler,&quot; he said. &quot;Welcome to Sacramento. My name is Mr. (print: $randomnamedone). How can I help you?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;we&#39;d like to buy some land.&quot; I noticed that compared to Mr. (print: $randomnamedone), my clothing was filty and tattered. We&#39;d have to fix that soon.

&quot;Of course. What type of land would you like? What do you hope to do now that you&#39;re here?&quot;

The problem is the wagon still weights about [|weightStat&gt;[$wagonweight]] pounds. I know I am supposed to keep it around {[(if: $wagontype is 1)[1,500](if: $wagontype is 2)[2,000](if: $wagontype is 3)[3,000]]} pounds.

So, now I am faced with a tough choice. Do I keep going without throwing anything to the side of the trail and risk breaking down again, or do I throw some things away to lighten the load?

So, now I am faced with a tough choice. Do I keep going without throwing anything to the side of the trail and risk breaking down again, or do I throw some things away to lighten the load?

We went north. The trail was fairly smooth. There were a few small hillocks, but generally, things were easy.

We caught up with another wagon train. It is considerably smaller than ours. There are only five wagons with eighteen men, three women, and two young children (I think they belong to the (display: &quot;chardesr1&quot;) woman). 

When we pulled up next to them a short while before sunset, they had already established their camp. Some of the men were watering their animals while the women were cooking supper and taking care of the children.

Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins](if: $captain is 3)[Powell] spoke with some of the men for a while. I don&#39;t know what they said, but Captain looked a little irritated.

We went south. The trail was indeed quite hilly. There were also quite a lot of trees in the little ravines. There was an odd scent in the air. I never could figure out what it was. It was sort of a mixture between pine and leather. I don&#39;t know how to explain it as it was unfamiliar to me.

Captain (if: $captain is 1)[Taylor didn&#39;t say much today as we struggled to push the wagons up each hill. He was actually away off on his horse for most of the day, &quot;Scouting&quot; as he calls it.](if: $captain is 2)[Hutchins helped out all day long. When wagons got stuck, he always seemed to be there, pushing on the back of a wagon or jamming a wedge under a wheel to keep it from slipping back.](if: $captain is 3)[Powell barely said anything all day. He used his horse to help guide the oxen along better paths into and out of each little valley between the hills. It made things much easier.]

We overtook a small wagon company of twenty wagons. The had several hundred head of loose cattle, all under the direction of Mr. Jackson. We had almost caught up with another wagon company but we stopped before we had a chance to do so.

While we were plodding along, &quot;,&quot;It is amazing how monotonous walking on the trail can be. Day after day, it is the same routine. We get up, eat breakfast, break camp, and begin driving the teams. Today, though, &quot;,&quot;I was driving the team today. We&#39;d been moving for at least a few hours. I wasn&#39;t exactly paying attention when &quot;,&quot;We were moving generally westward. I am not sure what time it was when &quot;,&quot;Today was like most other days. We got up early, broke camp, turned the wagons toward the west, and slowly began to move out. We hadn&#39;t made it very far when &quot;,&quot;We spent most of the day plodding along. At some point in the early afternoon, &quot;,&quot;We had been out of camp maybe an hour or so when &quot;,&quot;I was walking beside the wagon today when &quot;,&quot;We had stopped for a noon break. We watered the animals and had a bite to eat. When we started back out on the trail &quot;,&quot;The day started out like any other. We were up before dawn, made breakfast, got the team ready, started the animals out on the trail, and got our wheels rolling. It wasn&#39;t more than an hour though when &quot;,&quot;We were pulling out of a bit of a difficult section when &quot;,&quot;The days have started blurring together. The routine is both comforting and monotonous. It is nice because we don&#39;t really have to make any big decisions.

As of the time I am writing this, I still haven&#39;t seen them come into camp. Maybe they&#39;ll catch up with us tomorrow.&quot;,&quot;Captain halted the wagon train. A few of us worked together to get it repaired. Working together, we were able to get it fixed in no time.&quot;,&quot;We slowed down to see if they wanted help, but they just said to keep going. They would catch up with us.&quot;,&quot;Most of the wagon train kept rolling, but we stopped to help out. It took us about an hour or so to get it fixed. We were able to catch up with the rest of the company pretty quickly.&quot;,&quot;We offered to help get it fixed. They were grateful for our help. We got it fix in no time.&quot;,&quot;We offered to help, but they didn&#39;t want it. They actually yelled at us for a bit. We know they weren&#39;t made at us. They were just frustrated at their bad luck.&quot;,&quot;We all hate when this happens. It makes a good day, bad and a bad day, worse. We stopped for a while to help out. They didn&#39;t have a spare, so we had to fashion something by throwing together some parts from a few wagons. In the end, we got them up and running again. They&#39;ll have to get a real repair once we have the opportunity.&quot;,&quot;We pulled the wagon to a halt. At first, I wanted to make sure everyone was ok. After checking everyone and the animals, we got to work on making the repair. It took us quite a while to get everything fixed up, but then we kept making our way out west.&quot;,&quot;Captain was not very happy that we had to stop to make repairs, but it was done fairly quickly and we were back on the trail before too long.&quot;,&quot;It took us quite a while to get the repair done. Their wagon was overloaded, so we had to take out quite a lot before we could make the repair. They seemed more irritated with us for taking the stuff out of the wagon than they were about the actual damage. Go figure.&quot;,&quot;A few wagons pulled off the trail to assist. With many hands working on the problem, we were able to get it fixed pretty quickly. The tail end of the wagon train had passed us only a few minutes before we were ready to rejoin them. All in all, I was impressed with the skill and teamwork of everyone.&quot;,&quot;At first, we were a little frustrated, but it gave us a chance to stop for a bit. We watered the animals and got a quick bite to eat before they had the repairs completed. So, in a way, it was a nice, if unfortunate, break.&quot;,&quot;Almost nobody stopped to help - just me and one other wagon. I don&#39;t get it. If we all just pitched in, we could get repairs done much faster. As the saying goes, &#39;Many hands make light work.&#39; Then again, here I am sweating to make the repair while the others just keep rolling on.&quot;,&quot;It honestly didn&#39;t take us too long to make  the repairs as a large number of people pulled over to help. It was nice seeing everyone work together.&quot;)]}{
(if: _randomevent1 is 2)[(either: &quot;It was a typical day. We got up early. Had breakfast. Broke camp. Got underway. It was perhaps an hour or so later when &quot;,&quot;It was like any other day. We had finished eating breakfast and hitched up the teams.

The Captain had blown the call for everyone to stop. So, I rolled to a stop when &quot;,&quot;Another long day on the trail.

They thanked me and told me they would see me at camp tonight.&quot;,&quot;I pulled over to help them out, but the wife just waved and said they would take care of it. I asked if they were sure. She said they had already done this repair once before and would catch up to us later in the day. The thing is no one has seen them since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Captain sent back riders several times, but they never found them. I hope they&#39;re alright.&quot;,&quot;I attempted to stop and help, but the driver said not to bother. It shouldn&#39;t take them long to fix. I asked if they were sure and they just waved me off, thanking me for the offer. By the time we reached camp, they still hadn&#39;t shown up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Captain sent back some riders. When the returned, they reported that the wagon had been ransacked and there was no sign of the family.&quot;,&quot;A few of the wagons pulled over to help. By the time I managed to get there, they had basically completed the repairs. They thanked me for my offer even though I was too late.&quot;,&quot;I stopped to help. We were able to fix it and hardly any time. We got back on the trail while we could still the end of our wagon train. We caught up with the before they had even settled in for the night.&quot;,&quot;I was going to help, but when I asked if they needed it, they said they were good and would catch up with us later. When we hadn&#39;t heard from them, Captain sent back some riders. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When they came back to camp a bit after dark, they reported that the family had been killed. Many of the goods had been stolen and the rest were scattered all around their wagon. The Captain said a few words of remembrance. We all went to sleep with heavy hearts.&quot;)]}{

We didn&#39;t find anything of note, so we continued on.&quot;,&quot;we came across a single wagon tucked away in a depression of a small stream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we asked what they were doing out here all alone, they said they had left their company because too many people were getting sick.

We have no idea who might have made it or why, but it was in very poor condition leading us to believe it had been at least several years since anyone had lived in it.&quot;,&quot;we came across the carcass of an ox. It was bloated and full of maggots. We steered clear and preceded back to camp.&quot;,&quot;we stopped to speak with another wagon company. They had come from St. Joseph and had been on the trail about a week longer than us. They looked to be in good condition.&quot;,&quot;we stopped to speak with another wagon company.

While we were stopped, one of the scouts got bit by some sort of snake. By the time we got back to camp, his hand had swollen to three times the normal size. As I&#39;m writing this, I can hear his heavy breathing.&quot;,&quot;we ran across two Indians who were riding out of a gully. I think we surprised them as they were tense and ready for action. We tried to calm them by raising our hands and turning the houses to the side. This seemed to help, as they turn and galloped away in the other direction.&quot;,&quot;we came across a small trail fire. It was burning in a draw between two streams.&quot;,&quot;we saw evidence of a bison herd moving through the area. The land for at least a hundred feet wide had been trampled. Most of the grass had been destroyed. We reported this to Captain as well.&quot;,&quot;we saw some antelope in the distance but couldn&#39;t get close enough to take a shot.&quot;){

Take a tea spoon full or so as often as the case requires to keep the phlegm loose to raise easy.&quot;,&quot;If someone is about to give birth, we give the mother a &#39;Mother&#39;s Relief&#39; concoction.

After walking around for a while and talking with a number of people, I&#39;ve decided to leave my former wagon company and join with Captain Hutchins.

I feel a little bad about leaving the people I&#39;ve gotten to know, but I think this choice is better for me and my family.

As I was pulling my wagon over to this new company, I met a nice family. The McAlisters are very friendly and offer to help with anything. Kristine and her brother, Johannes, are taking their nephew, aged eleven, out to meet the rest of their extended family in The City of the Great Salt Lake.

While I was pulling my wagon over to the new company, I met a nice family. The Washburns are very knowledgeable. Hans, Emma, and their two sons, aged fifteen and seventeen have actually made this trip twice before – once going west and once going east. When I asked why they did so, they said they enjoyed the adventure. They said they made the first trip with just the husband and wife. They set up their homestead and came back to get their sons who were staying with their grandparents. Now, the whole family will be able to settle out west.

So, we mounted some horses and made our way out to the giant herd.

Some of the men who have served in the military or militia helped us get close without spooking the buffalo.

I&#39;ve got to say buffalo are HUGE! They make even a large bull look small. They are simply massive animals. Even the young calves are nearly as big as a cow. 

Anyway, we got close enough to fire of a volley of rifle shots. Within a matter of minutes, we killed nearly fifteen! 

It took us quite a while to clean and butcher them, but it was really worth it! We loaded up as much meat on the horses as we could and walked back to camp.

Every family, whether they were a part of the hunting party or not, received a lot of great meat!

The problem is the wagon still weights about [|weightStat&gt;[$wagonweight]] pounds. I know I am supposed to keep it around {[(if: $wagontype is 1)[1,500](if: $wagontype is 2)[2,000](if: $wagontype is 3)[3,000]]} pounds.

[[I&#39;m ready to get back on the trail.-&gt;crossroads1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="455" name="overloadedblackrockmtn1" tags="" position="7250,1750" size="200,100">I was able to finally get the broken wheel replaced. It is an experience I will never forget and, hopefully, will never have to repeat.

The problem is the wagon still weights about [|weightStat&gt;[$wagonweight]] pounds. I know I am supposed to keep it around {[(if: $wagontype is 1)[1,500](if: $wagontype is 2)[2,000](if: $wagontype is 3)[3,000]]} pounds. The more weight I put on it, the more likely it will break down again. The closer I am to the max weight of {[(if: $wagontype is 1)[2,500](if: $wagontype is 2)[3,000](if: $wagontype is 3)[4,500]]} pounds, the greater the chance something will break.

So, now I am faced with a tough choice. Do I keep going without throwing anything to the side of the trail and risk breaking down again, or do I throw some things away to lighten the load?

As of the time I am writing this, I still haven&#39;t seen them come into camp. Maybe they&#39;ll catch up with us tomorrow.&quot;,&quot;Captain halted the wagon train. A few of us worked together to get it repaired. Working together, we were able to get it fixed in no time.&quot;,&quot;We slowed down to see if they wanted help, but they just said to keep going. They would catch up with us.&quot;,&quot;Most of the wagon train kept rolling, but we stopped to help out. It took us about an hour or so to get it fixed. We were able to catch up with the rest of the company pretty quickly.&quot;,&quot;We offered to help get it fixed. They were grateful for our help. We got it fix in no time.&quot;,&quot;We offered to help, but they didn&#39;t want it. They actually yelled at us for a bit. We know they weren&#39;t made at us. They were just frustrated at their bad luck.&quot;,&quot;We all hate when this happens. It makes a good day, bad and a bad day, worse. We stopped for a while to help out. They didn&#39;t have a spare, so we had to fashion something by throwing together some parts from a few wagons. In the end, we got them up and running again. They&#39;ll have to get a real repair once we have the opportunity.&quot;,&quot;We pulled the wagon to a halt. At first, I wanted to make sure everyone was ok. After checking everyone and the animals, we got to work on making the repair. It took us quite a while to get everything fixed up, but then we kept making our way out west.&quot;,&quot;Captain was not very happy that we had to stop to make repairs, but it was done fairly quickly and we were back on the trail before too long.&quot;,&quot;It took us quite a while to get the repair done. Their wagon was overloaded, so we had to take out quite a lot before we could make the repair. They seemed more irritated with us for taking the stuff out of the wagon than they were about the actual damage. Go figure.&quot;,&quot;A few wagons pulled off the trail to assist. With many hands working on the problem, we were able to get it fixed pretty quickly. The tail end of the wagon train had passed us only a few minutes before we were ready to rejoin them. All in all, I was impressed with the skill and teamwork of everyone.&quot;,&quot;At first, we were a little frustrated, but it gave us a chance to stop for a bit. We watered the animals and got a quick bite to eat before they had the repairs completed. So, in a way, it was a nice, if unfortunate, break.&quot;,&quot;Almost nobody stopped to help - just me and one other wagon. I don&#39;t get it. If we all just pitched in, we could get repairs done much faster. As the saying goes, &#39;Many hands make light work.&#39; Then again, here I am sweating to make the repair while the others just keep rolling on.&quot;,&quot;It honestly didn&#39;t take us too long to make the repairs as a large number of people pulled over to help.

I know it wasn&#39;t nice of me, but I just sort of looked the other way and kept rolling.&quot;,&quot;I know I should have offered to help them make the repairs, but, to be honest, that family has never so much lifted a finger to help me out. A few days ago, I was carrying a load of stuff and something fell of the top. I asked if they could just place it back up there, and they just turned around and kept making dinner. So, I know it is wrong, but I just kept driving.&quot;,&quot;I stopped to help out, but they said they could manage it. They thanked me and told me they would see me at camp tonight.&quot;,&quot;I pulled over to help them out, but the wife just waved and said they would take care of it. I asked if they were sure. She said they had already done this repair once before and would catch up to us later in the day.

I hope they&#39;re alright.&quot;,&quot;I attempted to stop and help, but the driver said not to bother. It shouldn&#39;t take them long to fix. I asked if they were sure and they just waved me off, thanking me for the offer. By the time we reached camp, they still hadn&#39;t shown up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Captain sent back some riders. When the returned, they reported that the wagon had been ransacked and there was no sign of the family.&quot;,&quot;A few of the wagons pulled over to help. By the time I managed to get there, they had basically completed the repairs. They thanked me for my offer even though I was too late.&quot;,&quot;I stopped to help. We were able to fix it and hardly any time. We got back on the trail while we could still the end of our wagon train. We caught up with the before they had even settled in for the night.&quot;,&quot;I was going to help, but when I asked if they needed it, they said they were good and would catch up with us later.

They had been on the trail about ten days longer than we had. They wanted to know if we&#39;d be interested in trading. We told them to come by in the morning and speak with Captain.&quot;,&quot;one of the other scout&#39;s horse stumbled on a rock, throwing the rider. In the fall, he broke his arm. We patched him up as well as we could out there and then slowly made our way back to camp.&quot;,&quot;we stopped to fill our canteens. While we were stopped, one of the scouts got bit by some sort of snake. By the time we got back to camp, his hand had swollen to three times the normal size. As I&#39;m writing this, I can hear his heavy breathing.&quot;,&quot;we ran across two Indians who were riding out of a gully. I think we surprised them, as they were tense and ready for action. We tried to calm them by raising our hands and turning the houses to the side. This seemed to help, as they turn and galloped away in the other direction.&quot;,&quot;we came across a small trail fire. It was burning in a draw between two streams.&quot;,&quot;we saw evidence of a bison herd moving through the area. The land for at least a hundred feet wide had been trampled. Most of the grass had been destroyed. We reported this to Captain as well.&quot;,&quot;we saw some antelope in the distance but couldn&#39;t get close enough to take a shot.&quot;)

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(either:&quot;It is possible I am making some mistakes&quot;,&quot;I&#39;ll happily allow that I&#39;m making mistakes as I&#39;m just learning&quot;,&quot;Now, it is entirely possible that I am in error here&quot;), (either:&quot;but I have been using a book I borrowed from {(if: $captain is 1)[the Dunns](if: $captain is 2)[the McAlisters](if: $captain is 3)[the Washburns]} to learn.&quot;,&quot;but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m right.&quot;,&quot;but I think I&#39;ve seen these particular plants and animals before, so I think I&#39;m right.&quot;)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(either:&quot;It sometimes takes a while to figure out exactly what I&#39;m looking at as many of the plants look similar&quot;,&quot;I held up the drawing in the book next to the plant to see if it looked about the same&quot;,&quot;It is often quite difficult to correctly identify what I&#39;m looking at. I might think it is one thing, but then someone will correct me&quot;) (either:&quot;(sometimes with a little laughter).&quot;,&quot;(sometimes with a kind joke at my expense).&quot;,&quot;(sometimes by showing me where I was in error).&quot;)

(either: &quot;a badger with its characteristic short legs, stumpy tails, and flat bodies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was remarkably squat and sturdy. It was about two feet long and probably weighed somewhere in the range of fifteen or twenty pounds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must have scared it as when I got close to it, it started hissing and growling at me. It flashed its teeth at me before turning and running off. I noticed it had long, curved front claws.&quot;,
&quot;a bald eagle with its distinctive bald head. I know it is not actually bald like a vulture, but the plumage is white. Its large brown body and yellow beak are easy to see from a long way off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one I saw today started off high in the sky. I watched it off and on for almost an hour before it made its way off to the west.&quot;,
&quot;a bear with its distinctive dark brown fur. Maybe it was just the light, but in parts, its coat almost looked cinnamon in color. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was maybe five feet tall when it reared up to get a look at me before taking off. If I had to guess, the one I saw today was probably four hundred pounds or more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve seen a couple others in my life and I&#39;m glad they have a tendency to turn the other way when they encounter humans. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d like to ever get in a fight with one.&quot;,
&quot;a beaver with its distinctive brown, shiny coat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I spotted it a moment before it saw me. It was dragging a long branch down toward the water when it must have smelled or heard me. It dropped the branch and dashed for the water. With its large, flat tail, it slapped the water and disappeared. It is always surprising just how loud that slap can be - it almost sounds like a gunshot. As we passed by the little pod it had made with its dam, I saw the domelike lodge near the middle of the water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve tried a few times to get one for dinner, but they seem to have an almost instinctive ability to know when I&#39;m trying to do that. They slap the water and are gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know that trappers have much better success than hunters, but I just don&#39;t have the time to set traps and come back to check them. So, I keep rolling on.&quot;,
&quot;a black bear with its distinctive dark, nearly black fur. Maybe it was just the light, but in parts, its coat almost looked blue-black in color. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was maybe five feet tall when it reared up to get a look at me before taking off.

(either: &quot;a black-billed cuckoo with its distinctive brownish-gray body with cream crest and black and cream striped tail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve heard them a few times signing at night as they flew over the camp, but I&#39;ve rarely seen them. The one I saw today was flittering around inside some brush, catching insects I think.&quot;,
&quot;a blackbird with its distinctive glossy, almost liquid-like, feathers of black, midnight blue, and shiny green. It has a piercing yellow eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My understanding is that the females are much harder to spot as their plumage blends in much better with the prairie grass. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever seen one.&quot;,
&quot;a black-capped chickadee with its distinctive happy-sounding chick-a-dee song.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There must have been a dozen or so of these little guys flittering about the grasses. They would forage by hopping from twigs to grass to small branches of nearby shrubs and trees. I&#39;ve even seen a few hanging upside down to reach some fruit hanging low on the branch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These birds are also very nimble fliers. I&#39;ve watched them catch insects midair. Quite a sight to see.&quot;,
&quot;a black-crowned night-heron with its distinctive white belly and dark blue top. The one I saw today had yellow legs and orange-red eyes. It was standing on a log at the edge of a small stream.

&quot;a black-footed ferret with its distinctive light brown or tan coat and dark mask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve rarely seen them as they are quite secretive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe the one I saw today was hunting prairie dogs as it was lurking around some burrows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one I saw today was about a foot-and-a-half-long.&quot;,
&quot;a black-tailed prairie dog with its characteristic plump little body. I saw another few dozen today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They love to stand on the entrance to their burrows and look around. Whenever anything of interest happens, they all rear up and yip or bark at the sky. I&#39;ve seen several doing this tumble over backward. It makes me laugh every time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They will also seem to kiss each other when they first meet. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. They are playful creatures and will run around chasing each other between grazing or watching the prairie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I enjoy seeing them even though their burrow holes can be a bit of change for our livestock and horses.&quot;,)]

(either: &quot;a bluebird with its representative blue wings, warm red-brown breast, and white bottom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The little guy I saw today was sitting on the top of some tall grass. Its head was in constant motion as it seemed to watch everything all at once.&quot;,
&quot;a bobcat with its distinctive long legs, large paws, and tufted ears. The ears look a little like those of the lynx.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I only saw it for a moment before it was gone. It blends into the prairie nearly perfectly. The one I saw was maybe three feet long and probably weighed twenty or twenty-five pounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve been told they like to eat rabbits, birds, squirrels, mice, and other small prey. One of the others said they had heard of a bobcat taking out a deer fawn.&quot;,
&quot;a bullfrog with its distinctive baritone call that is so deep and resonant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one I saw today was a greenish, gray-brown with spots on either side of its head. Normally, they are out at night and will eat anything that they can fit in their mouth. I&#39;ve seen two male bullfrogs in battle fighting for their territory.&quot;,
&quot;a bull snake with its characteristic enlarged nose and brown and tan pattern. The one I saw today also had an almost black and tan or cream coloration nearer its head. A few of the others called it a gopher snake, but I&#39;ve never had it called that before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one I saw slithering through the grass today was a bit over five feet long. It hissed at me for a moment and moved its tail back and forth like a rattlesnake, but it didn&#39;t fool me.&quot;,
&quot;a Canada goose with its characteristic gray plumage, black neck and beak, and black and white head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.The geese I saw today were about three feet long.

&quot;a copperhead with its distinctive copper colored, triangular head copper and brown body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the east coast, we would often call these water moccasins. The one I saw today was maybe a yard long. I&#39;m actually kind of surprised to see it out here on the prairie. Normally, you&#39;d find these snakes in more forested or swampy areas back east.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I told some of the others that I saw a copperhead, they said it was a good thing that it didn&#39;t strike out at me. Apparently, unlike most vipers, this snake will stand its ground and keep striking. One old timer said he stepped on one when he was young. It bite him but didn&#39;t inject any venom.&quot;,
&quot;a coyote with its distinctive tan body and creeping gate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one I saw was maybe four feet from tip to tip. I probably weighed near thirty or thirty-five pounds. I first saw it down near a little creek eating something. When it saw me, it lifted its head, and trotted off. I&#39;ve seen them eat almost anything they can get - everything from rabbits to fish to frogs to snakes to even small deer. I guess they are just opportunistic feeders. At night, we can sometimes hear them yipping and howling. We&#39;ve even had a few come in fairly close to our camp to snap up an unsupervised hunk of beef or bacon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We usually try to kill them when we see them for this reason. They are, however, pretty sneaky and blend into the prairie well so it is hard to see them.&quot;,
&quot;a crow with its distinctive flat black body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one I saw today was in a group of five others. They were harassing a prairie dog. They would swoop down on it then flitter away.

So, I guess they&#39;re omnivores after all.&quot;,
&quot;a goldeneye duck with its characteristic golden eye. Its eyes are brilliant and easy to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a medium-sized duck. The male&#39;s plumage is white and a dark, reflective green-black. The female, like most birds, is muted browns and cream or tan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those I saw today were bobbing on a small pond.&quot;,
&quot;a goldfinch with its distinctive lemon-colored plumage. Well, at least the male is brightly colored. The females, on the other hand, are dull brown. This is so they can hide better from predators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.It has a conical shaped beak that it uses to eat different types of seeds. The few that I saw today were all about five inches long with a wingspan of about eight inches.&quot;,
&quot;a gopher with its little teeth and long whiskers was above ground long enough for me to see him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was maybe six or seven inches long and covered in a grayish fur. I&#39;m not sure he was doing above ground as he is likely to be picked off by a predator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a few minutes, he disappeared in the grass.&quot;,
&quot;a grackle with its distinctive dark bill, pale yellowish eyes, and long tail. Its feathers appeared almost black with blue iridescence on the head. The body also had an almost bronze sheen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It was about a foot long with a wingspan of maybe a foot-and-a-half. It made a peculiar call.

The rest of the feathers were blue-gray or white.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At first I didn&#39;t see it, as it was standing perfectly still, but then it caught my eye as it waded slowly through the water. It startled me when its beak shot out lightning fast to catch a fish in the shallows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Its movements reminded me of our trip. Sometimes it feels like we&#39;re stuck and not moving at all. Other times our wagon train moves slow as molasses. Sometimes I wish I had wings like the heron so I could fly instead of being stuck in a bumpy wagon&quot;,
&quot;a great egret with its distinctive white feathers, thin, elegant frame, and bright yellow, pointed bill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It was gliding through the air when I first saw it. Only flapping its wings every 30 seconds or so, slowly making its way across the horizon. I was in awe of its wide wingspan as it came down to land, then slowly waded through a small pond. At a closer distance I was able to spot the beautiful green feathers arounds its eyes, the ones that are so prized as hat adornments for fashionable women.&quot;,
&quot;a great plains rat snake with its distinctive pointy spear mark atop its head, brown eye stripe, and blotchy brown patches of scales over its otherwise tan body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wouldn&#39;t have seen it at all if I hadn&#39;t moved a few rocks. It started vibrating its tail furiously, warning me to back off. If I hadn&#39;t known any better, I might have mistaken it for a rattlesnake. I am glad it was just a rat snake, since they aren&#39;t venomous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I let it be, setting the rocks down a few feet way away.&quot;,
&quot;a grebe with its distinctive lobed feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I knew it had to be a grebe by the weird way it walked on land. Its legs were set far back on its body. Once it was in the water though, it was graceful as a swan, diving down under the water as it looked for food. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Back in Missouri, some of the wealthier women I saw wore grebe feather hats. Those feathers didn&#39;t seem to help the poor bird fly. I watched one try and try to take off, but it never made it off the ground.

Even its feet were covered in feathers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bird seemed just as interested in me, as I was in it, looking at me curiously before wandering off into the brush.&quot;,
&quot;a gull with its distinctive white feathers and annoying call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its body was sleek and when it stretched out its wings, I was surprised at just how long they were. It picked here and there with its hooked bill. Probably snatching up bugs.&quot;,
&quot;a hawk with its distinctive hooked beak, large eyes, and sharp claws.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I guess that is why they are so great at hunting prey.&quot;,
&quot;a hispid cotton rat with its characteristic grizzled black coat and stiff guard hairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This species of rat has a shorter, notched down nose, large eyes, and short, hairless tail.&quot;,
&quot;a house mouse with its distinctive black eyes, large round ears, pointed muzzle, and long, hairy tail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; You don&#39;t normally see them scurrying about during the day.

Mice seem like they can find their way into any food supply.&quot;,
&quot;a magpie with its characteristic heavy, black bill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was mostly black with shimmers of blue and green, except for its white patches on its wings and solid white breast. Its tail feathers were long, maybe even longer than the rest of its body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The magpie squeaked and squawked, making all kinds of racket. Of course that brought out others and pretty soon there was a whole parliament of bickering, cawing birds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; They followed us for a while, maybe hoping we would leave some sort of animal carcass behind for them to pick at. With all that noise, it is a good thing they feed on carrion. I don&#39;t know how they ever catch a lizard with the noise they make.&quot;,
&quot;a kestrel with its distinctive warm and bright rusty-red feathers, slate-blue head, and large, round eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s short, hooked beak snapped open and shut with quick, squeaky calls. Kestrels are quite small compared to other birds of prey. This one was only about a foot long.&quot;,
&quot;a kingbird with its characteristic ashy gray feathers, bright yellow breast, and black tail trimmed with white edges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living up to its royal name, the bird was driving off a hawk, its head plumage raised, exposing a splash of crimson red feathers on its crown. The aggressive bird had a quick, high chitter while it snapped at the much larger predator.&quot;,)]

&quot;a least weasel with its distinctive slender body, short legs, and brown pelt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it lifted its head, I saw that the underside of its neck and belly were white. The weasel was small, only about six inches, even with its long neck and tail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I must have gotten too close, as I could smell the musky odor they put off when they are frightened. I&#39;ve seen weasel fur in some of the shops and it is so soft. I wonder how they get that smell out of the pelts, as the musk was pretty pungent.&quot;,
&quot;a long-tailed weasel with its distinctive long, black-tipped tail, short legs, and thin frame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its brown back, it blended into the ground. This one was about a foot from tip to tail and had a whitish, yellowish belly. It was dragging that belly over the ground, probably marking its territory, as I could smell a strong, musky odor. I bet its pelt would have made a pair of warm gloves.&quot;,
&quot;a blue jay with its distinctive noisy, harsh call and blue plumage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It&#39;s perky crest sat stiffly atop its head as it looked about. The tail feathers were shades of magnificent, bright blue, striped with black, as were its wings. The white breast seemed plain compared to the rest of the decorative bird. It amazed me that something so beautiful could sound so terrible. A fellow pioneer said that they can have a bell-like song, but I&#39;ve never heard it. Maybe it sounds sweet if you&#39;re tone-deaf or have spent too many days on the prairie. I found the birds call irritating.&quot;,
&quot;a mallard with its distinctive glossy, green head, gray-brown body and wings, and black tail paddled about a small pond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His female companion seemed plain in comparison with her muted brown feathers. She quacked and splashed, while the male made quieter, rasping noises. The ducks bobbed under the water from time to time and nipped at their feathers with their bills.&quot;,
&quot;a meadow jumping mouse with its characteristic round body, short front legs, larger back legs, and extremely long, thin, hairless tail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It definitely earns its name. I thought frogs could jump, but that little mouse sprang into action when I came upon it.&quot;,)]

I wish I could have plucked it off the log it was basking on to look at its underside. They have bright patterns of red and black.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;m surprised that we only saw one.

&quot;a mink with its characteristic sleek, slender body, long neck and tail, and short, stubby legs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we had time to set some traps, we could trim our coats with their soft brown fur. It swam through the stream and then slipped into a hole on the opposite bank.&quot;,
&quot;a mockingbird with its continuous song of different animal calls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It mimicked a variety of birds and at one point it even sounded like a frog! Mockingbirds are not very large. I might have confused it with a thrush, but it had a longer tail and was thinner. They also have small heads with long, thin bills. Its beak sort of curved downward.

That&#39;s not counting the tail, which seemed to be as long as its body. Unlike its tail, its body was stocky and its head was round. The muskrat&#39;s ears and eyes were tiny. So were its feet, at the end of its short, little legs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only appealing characteristic was its soft, thick fur. It was a glossy reddish-brown.&quot;,
&quot;a northern bobwhite with its distinctive mottled-brown and white body and head with a strip of black over white.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It repeatedly whistled its emphatic &#39;bob-white&#39; as we rolled by. They make for a good stew, but I didn&#39;t want to shoot the one I saw today.&quot;,
&quot;a northern grasshopper mouse with its distinctive silky reddish brown and gray coat and white belly. It has a shorter tail than most mice, only about 2 or 3 inches. Its tail was about half its body length. It was doing what most mice are always doing - eating.&quot;,

&quot;a northern water snake with its distinctive brown blotches on its scales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I almost died of fright as I scooped my pale into the stream to get water to refill our barrel.

&quot;a phoebe with its characteristic call that sounds like a slurred whistle and whirring hiccup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its cinnamon belly and gray head and wings blended in with the surroundings so well, I almost didn&#39;t spot it.

I think it might have done flipping the tunnel to turn itself around. A fellow traveler said they can do that because they have loose skin. I guess they use their tails, which are bare and don&#39;t have fur, to feel where they are going when they go backwards. I wouldn&#39;t want gophers in my garden. They would make quick work of all the roots and tubers.&quot;,
&quot;a porcupine with its characteristic quills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a round body, short legs, and small ears, it looked like a spiky, shaggy sack with a tail. I kept my distance as I didn&#39;t want to turn into a pincushion and spend the evening pulling out quills.&quot;,
&quot;a prairie dog colony with its representative sentries standing guard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could have sat and watched them for hours. Their squeaky yips back and forth alerted the town to my arrival. Some barked so much that they fell over backwards!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their small, brown, furry bodies would dip in and out of their burrows. Sometimes they would just poke out a head with their tiny rounded ears. Even though they are only about a foot long and have short legs, they sure are fast! They would dash from burrow to burrow, running like their life depended on it. Come to think of it, it does depend on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The captain doesn&#39;t like the colonies. Horse death traps he calls them. If one of the livestock were to step wrong and get its hoof stuck in the hole, it could break a leg and need to be put down.&quot;,)]

(either: &quot;a prairie kingsnake with its distinctive backward V marking on its head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of its scales were a brownish gray, with dark blotches down its back and side that were more reddish brown. It tried to pretend it was a rattlesnake and vibrate its tail at me, but I knew better. It doesn&#39;t have a rattle! Some folks are fooled into thinking kingsnakes are copperheads, but copperheads have hourglass shaped-markings, while the kingsnakes are more spotted and round.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Venomous or not, I keep my distance from snakes and prefer they keep their distance from me. It isn&#39;t worth the risk.&quot;,
&quot;a prairie vole with its distinctive short ears and tail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had long, coarse grayish-brown fur along most of its body, except for some yellowish fur on the bottom. There sure are a lot of different kinds of rodents. They all look so similar.&quot;,
&quot;a prairie-chicken with its distinctive barred brown and white feathers. They blend in well with the brush.&quot;,
&quot;a pronghorn with its characteristic backward-curving horns that split to form forward-pointing prongs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pronghorns are smaller than deer, only about three feet tall at the shoulders. They are mostly reddish brown, with white stomachs and stripes on their throat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one I saw was alone, so it must have been a male. If it were a female it would have been with a herd of other females.&quot;,
&quot;a quail with its distinctive arched feathers going forward from its forehead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a found bird with a small head and a gray breast. It flew away when I approached, spreading its short, broad wings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It left behind a feather. It reminded me of the feather hats I saw in shops in St. Louis, so I put it in my pocket. Who knows, maybe it will be part of a nice hat when we make it to our final stop.&quot;,
&quot;a raccoon with its distinctive bushy, ringed tail of alternating dark and light fur and its mask of black fur across its eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a curious animal, watching me as I watched it. It gave me time to study its sharp claws and teeth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A couple of other pioneers have coonskin caps, including the tail. They sure are soft and warm.&quot;,
&quot;a rat with its distinctive pointed head, large eyes and hairless ears, and long hairless tail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had sharp teeth and claws, so I kept my distance.&quot;,)]

(either: &quot;a rattlesnake with its characteristic rattle at the tip of its tail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had a broad, triangular head and vertical pupils, like a cat, with a split tongue. I kept my distance when its tail started to slowly vibrate back and forth. It didn&#39;t need to tell me twice to stay away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a big snake, even coiled up I could see that it was thicker than most snakes. Its scales made an intricate patterns of browns and tans.&quot;,
&quot;a raven with its distinctive black profile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only are its feathers black, but its eyes, beak, and legs are as well. It was a large bird, about two feet tall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I could tell it was a raven and not a crow by its wedge shape tail and its low, croaking squawk.&quot;,
&quot;a red fox with its distinctive red fur, long snout, and large, pointed ears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its throat, chin, and stomach were more white, as was the tip of its tail. The fox had black feet and fur at the tip of its ears. It was not very big, maybe three feet long and two feet tall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If not for its tail, I probably won&#39;t have seen it slinking along at all. It was very cautious and hid itself well. It was probably hunting a rabbit.&quot;,
&quot;a red-sided garter snake with its characteristic stripes of color scales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had three tannish yellow stripes from tongue to tail, one down the center of its back and one on its each side. It had vertical red, orange, and brown bars of scales between the yellow stripes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was able to study its scales more closely since it is not a venomous snake. The snake had a narrow head and body and was about 3 feet long.&quot;,
&quot;a red-winged blackbird with its representative red and yellow feathers on its upper wings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rest of its feathers were black and glossy, as were its eyes, beak, and legs. It must have been a male, as the females are brown, like most female birds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn&#39;t very big, just about eight inches tall. While it was chatty, it was not very loud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was surprised to see it alone, as they are normally found in flocks. Maybe it was just trying to find some quiet time. I can relate to that with being with the same people day in and day out.&quot;,
&quot;a river otter with its distinctive sleek, cylindrical body and small head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had a very long tail, about a third of the length of its body, that was quite round, coming a point at the end. On either side of its head it had the tiniest ears. Its whiskers were long and plentiful. At the end of the otters short legs were webbed feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those webbed feet help it paddle through the water. I came across it swimming when I was filling a bucket from a pond. It didn&#39;t seem to mind sharing the pond with me.&quot;,)]

(either: &quot;a sandhill crane with its distinctive red head, gray body, and black-tipped wings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I learned that the scientific name is &#39;antigone canadensis &#39; - I don&#39;t know why, but I like the sound of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one I saw today must have stood nearly four feet tall with a wingspan of nearly six feet. It was the most impressive bird. Its neck and legs are quite long. As I watched, it took flight. It flies with its neck stretch straight out.&quot;,
&quot;a sandpiper with its distinctive.&quot;,
&quot;a skunk with its characteristic black fur and white stripes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I would have loved to touch that bushy tail, I knew better than to get too close. Trail life would not have been improved by getting sprayed by a skunk and smelling up the camp and wagon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While not as common as other pelts, I’ve seen skunk pelts for sale here and there. Most of the pelts are shipped to Europe.&quot;,
&quot;a sparrow with its distinctive chirp and mixture of brown, black, and white feathers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a whole flock of them twittering away, singing their sweet, twinkling songs. In the midst of the long, hard journey, it was nice to sit and enjoy the beauty of nature for a short time.&quot;,
&quot;a squirrel with its distinctive bushy tail and twitchy, nervous movements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It didn’t sit still for long, always on the lookout for food to store away for winter.&quot;,
&quot;a swallow with its distinctive long, deeply forked tail&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It darted gracefully above the grass, looking for bugs. The light glisted off its brilliant blue feathers on its back and head. It’s face and neck were more rust colored, with brownish gray feathers on its wings and fanlike tail.&quot;,
&quot;a swan with its characteristic large white body and long, gracefully curved neck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only are their feathers used to adorn hats, but you can use their skins for powder puffs and their flight feathers for writing quills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every so often, it would dip its head under the surface of the water to nibble on some vegetation.&quot;,)]
(if: ((_prairieanimals1 is 17) and (_randomplantsoranimals1 is 2)))[
(either: &quot;a turkey with its characteristic waddle and fan of feathers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they make for a good meal, they are not especially pretty birds in sight or sound. Their gobble is actually rather comical and their naked head of red and blue almost grotesque.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Individually, the feathers are quite beautiful, some are striped and others iridescent. Together, they look like a bird who could not decide what to wear so it put on a hodgepodge of feather colors and styles.&quot;,
&quot;a turtle with its representative shelled armor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He poked up its head from under the surface of the water and I could see the outline of its appendages splayed out as it swam. It blended in well with the murkiness of the waterhole.&quot;,
&quot;a vulture with its distinctive featherless red head, black body, and gray flight feathers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its wingspan was large and impressive, although it more wabbled in the air than glided. The feathers at the end of its wings looked like long fingers, while its tail feathers stayed more tightly tucked together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seeing one of these scavengers brings death to the forefront of my mind. Always on the lookout for its next meal, the next rotting carcass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even a shallow grave is no deterrent to these birds of prey. I once saw one feasting on what was left of a pioneer that had been left behind with a small headstone of rocks.&quot;,
&quot;a wapiti with its representative velvity, sharp antlers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wouldn’t want to be charged by one of these large beasts. Even without their impressive rack of antlers, elk tower over even the tallest men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This one was quickly joined by a small group of other elk, maybe another half dozen. They all had light brown fur, thicker on their faces and necks, and a light colored patch on their rumps.&quot;,
&quot;a white-tailed deer with its distinctive white-tipped tail. The tail is what sets it apart from a mule deer, which has a black-tipped tail. That and white-tailed deer antlers don’t have quite as many branches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was part of a small herd of deer grazing on grass. I watched in silence so as not to frighten them. Even so, they still would put their heads up and freeze, always ready to dash away at the first sign of danger.&quot;,
&quot;a wolf with its distinctive flowing gait. Its hind legs would swing in line with its front legs, making it seem effortless as it moved across the landscape. Its long, bushy tail trailed behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been many nights where I awoke to the howls of a wolf pack. To see one was both exhilarating and frightening. They are beautiful and powerful animals, capable of taking down our largest pack animals when they hunt as a pack. I hope this one doesn’t find our camp for the night.&quot;,
&quot;a woodchuck with its representative grizzled fur. Its body was stocky and its tail average, not at all like other squirrels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone in camp seems to have a different name for it - groundhog, land beaver, whistling pig…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I wonder is can a woodchuck actually chuck wood? If so, how much wood can a woodchuck chuck?&quot;,)]

After things were quiet and still, &quot;,&quot;I walked for a while without seeing anything, but then &quot;,&quot;I was tired from the day, but walking for a while helped wake me up. I made my way along a small stream, and &quot;,&quot;It didn&#39;t take very long, but &quot;,&quot;I had been waiting for a while before I saw anything. To be honest, I almost fell asleep just sitting out there. Motion caught my eye, and &quot;,&quot;I walked away from the wagon train for more than two miles before I started hunting. Once I did, I was surprised at how much game I saw. It wasn&#39;t long before &quot;,&quot;I crossed through the grass for a while before I started hunting. Once I did, &quot;,&quot;A few other people went hunting at the same time. I was worried they would chase away any game, but &quot;,&quot;I hunted for a long time.

I brought up my rifle, aimed carefully, and &quot;,&quot;I walked away from the wagon train for twenty minutes or so. I sat down on a rock to simply look out over the prairie. In a way, it is actually kind of pretty. After a while, I saw some motion. I brought up my rifle, and &quot;,&quot;After twenty minutes or so of walking away from the train, I saw some motion. I halted, holding my breath. I lifted the rifle, took careful aim, and fired, &quot;,&quot;I walked for nearly a mile before I settled in next to an old oak. After some time, I saw some game. It lifted my rifle, and &quot;,&quot;It was nice to get away from the wagons. After some time, I saw some game. It lifted my rifle, took aim, and &quot;,&quot;I walked for thirty minutes or so before I settled in next to an elm tree. I watched the sun go down for a while before I saw some game. It lifted my rifle, took aim, and &quot;,&quot;I walked for nearly two hours. I was about to give up and head back when motion caught my eye. I took up my rifle, took aim, and &quot;,&quot;I worked my way carefully through the grass but it was a long while before I saw any game. Eventually, I heard something moving, so I raised my rifle, took a shot, and &quot;,&quot;I spent quite a while sneaking through the grass before I saw anything. When I did, I slowly lifted my rifle to my shoulder. I took aim, and &quot;,&quot;I wandered away from the wagon train for a mile or two. It was nice getting away from the wagons for a while. It took a while, but &quot;,&quot;After nearly an hour of hunting, I finally spotted something. I lifted my rifle and fired, and &quot;,&quot;It took me several hours, but I finally spotted some game.

It took us four days!

We made it up the river on the first day, but as we were making camp, a huge sandstorm blew in. It lasted for several hours and everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was completed covered and filled with sand. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.

On the second day, we took everything out of the wagons so we could make sure to reseal the joints with tar and paper. All the containers were made as watertight as we could make them.

The third day, we started across the Green River. The water was maybe six inches too deep. Many of the smaller wagons began floating before they were even a third of the way across. Only the largest and heaviest wagons didn&#39;t float. Instead, they became swamped.

Additional teams had to be used to pull them across and out of the river.

On the third night, we camped almost directly across the Green from where were were three days ago.

On the fourth day, we had no problems and were able to drive almost twenty-five miles.

At one point, we passed by a large body of water. It must have been nearly five-hundred acres. 

Some fool let his horse get too close and it drank the water. He should have known better. All the signs were there. The grasses at the edge were yellowish-red. Its likely the horse will be dead by morning.

We are all exhausted.

We&#39;ve spent  (print: $daysonthetrail) on the Trail since leaving Independence, Missouri! I&#39;d estimate we drove (print: $totalmiles) miles.

The valley is beautiful! We can clearly see the Great Salk Lake shining in the sun. There is a wide series of wide valleys broken up with mountain ranges. I&#39;d estimate the ranges are probably somewhere about twenty miles apart. 

To the south, we can see additional mountains and what looks like another lake, although it is much smaller.

Right below us, there are a number of buildings and what appears to be farms spread out north to south.

It is a wonderous sight!

This evening, we were sitting around the campfire and a few of the others got to talking about politics. 

I generally stayed away from such topics and was just silently listening when someone asked a question for us to answer.

When it came time for me to respond, I tried to say I wasn&#39;t listening, but they repeated everything and asked again.

So I felt like I had to say something.

The questions was, &quot;In the presidential election in &#39;48, who had a larger percentage of the popular vote?&quot;

}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="559" name="captain1" tags="" position="2100,2300" size="200,100">Alright, it is time for me to chose a wagon train captain. This decision will affect at least the next few months of my life. I’d better choose wisely.

I know that &lt;b&gt;Mr. Henry Taylor&lt;/b&gt; is confident. Everyone talks about how sure he is of himself. He seems to be able to get things done. I&#39;ve watched him and his wagon company and it seems like they are always finished before the other wagon trains. I believe his wagon train has more than a hundred wagons now. He seems to be pretty happy with the size of it, telling everyone that he has the strongest and the best company on the plains. (either:&quot;I&#39;ve heard that Mr. Porter was taken to court over the loss of someone&#39;s wagon and goods on a previous crossing, but I don’t&#39; know if that is true or not.&quot;,&quot;&quot;)

&lt;b&gt;Mr. William Hutchins&lt;/b&gt; seems a little less confident. He seems to prefer to watch and listen before he makes up his mind. His wagon company has also been getting ready. Mr. Hutchins seems to move around a lot between the families. They tend to smile when he approaches. The last time I checked, his company was somewhere near 60 wagons or so. (either:&quot;I&#39;ve heard that Mr. Hutchins can sometimes be slow to make a decision. Apparently, in a previous wagon company, it took him too long to make a decision and a young child died. Of course, that is just a rumor.&quot;,&quot;&quot;)

My final option is &lt;b&gt;Mr. George Powell&lt;/b&gt;. He&#39;s a quiet, cautious, and serious man. He doesn&#39;t appear to be very old, but I&#39;ve heard that he has made several trips across the prairie. However, I think this is his first as a captain. I haven&#39;t been able to count the number of wagons in his company, but it doesn&#39;t look like that many. I honestly don&#39;t know a lot about Mr. Powell. (either:&quot;He rarely speaks and most people I&#39;ve spoken with don&#39;t know too much about him either.&quot;,&quot;&quot;) (either: &quot;Someone said he has a rich uncle who works in the federal government, but I don&#39;t know if he does or not.&quot;,&quot;&quot;)

Dear Diary,

I can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve made it here. It has already been a long journey to even make it this far. We are excited about the adventure that lay before us, but we are also all a little tired. Not a great way to start a trip, but we&#39;ll be fine.

I just looked over at {(if: (($spouse is 1) and ($gender is 1)))[(print: $wifesname1). I can&#39;t believe how I luck I am to have her as my wife. She is so smart, and funny, and kind, and a great listener. I am so fortunate.](if: (($spouse is 1) and ($gender is 2)))[(print: $husbandsname1).

I am so lucky that my (print: $travelpartner1) agreed to join me on the trail. I honestly don&#39;t hink I would have made it this far with them. Granted, we don&#39;t always see eye to eye, but I wouldn&#39;t  want anyone else with me.]} 

As I look around the town, I can&#39;t believe how many people there are here. I don&#39;t know what I was expecting, but there&#39;s got to be (either: &quot;hundreds&quot;,&quot;hundreds and hundreds&quot;,&quot;thousands&quot;,&quot;thousands and thousands&quot;) of people (either: &quot;bustling&quot;,&quot;scurring&quot;,&quot;dashing&quot;,&quot;scrambling&quot;) about town. There&#39;s so much (either: &quot;commotion&quot;,&quot;confusion&quot;,&quot;excitement&quot;,&quot;energy&quot;) as everyone in the whole (either: &quot;world&quot;,&quot;country&quot;,&quot;region&quot;,&quot;state&quot;,&quot;area&quot;) seems to be getting ready to head out west.

I don&#39;t know how to (either: &quot;describe it clearly&quot;,&quot;explain it clearly&quot;,&quot;communicate it properly&quot;), but there are more animals here than I&#39;ve seen in any one place in my life. I&#39;ve seen more (either: &quot;horses, oxen, and sheep&quot;,&quot;oxen, horses, and mules&quot;,&quot;mules, cows, and sheep&quot;,&quot;cows, oxen, and pigs&quot;) than I can count. Some people are shouting and hollering while others seem to be carrying just about all sorts of everything. I&#39;ve seen people carrying (either: &quot;rolled up tents&quot;,&quot;long rolls of canvas&quot;), (either: &quot;pieces of lumber&quot;,&quot;pieces of iron&quot;), and (either: &quot;barrels full of food&quot;,&quot;chests full of clothes&quot;).

I don&#39;t mind really, it just wasn&#39;t what I expected. Somehow, I thought things would be (either: &quot;calmer&quot;,&quot;serene&quot;,&quot;tranquil&quot;,&quot;low-key&quot;,&quot;peaceful&quot;).

Anyway, it took me a bit of time to get my bearings here. I&#39;ve passed through more cities and towns in the last few months than I can recall. Independence is like a lot of the other towns I&#39;ve been through. There&#39;s a (either: &quot;courthouse, county jail, and a bunch of churches&quot;,&quot;a couple of schools, a county jail, and a bunch of one story houses&quot;,&quot;ton of houses, a county jail, and a large courthouse&quot;,&quot;market house, a courthouse, and a bunch of houses&quot;,&quot;courthouse, a county jail, a couple of schools, a market house, and a bunch of churches&quot;).

While I was walking around the town, something strange happened. {(either: &quot;I was walking along and found five dollars just sitting there in the dirt! I looked around to see if anyone was missing anything, but no one looked like they were searching, so I put it in my pocket. (set: $money to it + 5)(set:$morale to it + 5)&quot;,&quot;I think I&#39;ve been pickpocketed! I was certain I had five more dollars when I started out this morning than I do now. Maybe I just lost it somewhere. Either way, I am now five dollars poorer.(set: $money to it - 5)(set:$morale to it - 5)&quot;,&quot;I was just looking around and I saw a small child crying. I stopped to ask what was wrong. He said that he was an orphan and that he was lost. I asked him where he was trying to get to. He described the place to me, and I knew where it was! I passed the place only a few minutes before. So, I walked him them. I&#39;m pretty happy with how things turned out.(set:$morale to it + 5)&quot;)}

For now, I&#39;ll decide what to do with the rest of the evening.

Sometimes having someone who is clearly opinionated and in charge is a benefit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Mr. Hutchins seems a bit unsure of himself. This might just be the sign of a good leader, though. Maybe his seeming self-doubt is just him listening to what everyone else has to say. So, it could either be good or bad. Its hard to tell at this point. I&#39;ve heard rumors that support either side of it, so I don&#39;t know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Powell, now he&#39;s the real mystery to me. I can&#39;t figure him out. He&#39;s either real smart or real dumb. I don&#39;t know which. It is also hard because nobody really seems to know a lot about him.
